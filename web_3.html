McKinsey analysis on schooling (primary, secondary, and tertiary education) was based on publicly available data from Eurostat, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) focused on the EU-27 member countries (see footnotes in the exhibits). Proprietary analysis on the European workforce conducted by McKinsey jointly with <a href="https://eightfold.ai/">Eightfold AI</a>, an AI platform for talent development, in August 2022 was based on Eightfold AI’s proprietary database on the European workforce. The analysis focused on the EU-27 member countries, Eightfold AI’s proprietary data set of more than 60 million European workforce profiles, and more than one million tech profiles.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>To better understand why Europe struggles to find and retain tech-talented women, and to determine how best to address the issue, we undertook a detailed analysis of the entire development funnel in Europe, from primary school all the way to entering the workforce (see sidebar, “About the research”). The analysis produced some interesting insights:</p>

<ul>
<li>A significant drop in the percentage of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) classes happens at two points: during the transition from primary and secondary education to university, when it drops 18 percentage points, and during the transition from university to the workforce, when it drops another 15 (Exhibit 1).</li>
<li>While the rate of women working within tech <em>companies</em> (such as social networks) is closer to parity, the rate of women working within tech <em>roles</em> (such as developers and data engineers) is much lower.</li>
<li>The problem is likely to get worse. Women’s graduation rate in STEM disciplines during higher education is declining.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="35d3e1ab-3db2-461d-9c3d-fcdb674da672"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">6</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="35d3e1ab-3db2-461d-9c3d-fcdb674da672" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Eurostat data.</span></span></span></a></span> Furthermore, the share of women in the workforce is lowest in the tech roles that are growing fastest, such as DevOps and cloud. At current rates, the share of women in tech roles in Europe is heading toward a decline to 21 percent by 2027.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a tough problem to solve. However, although there are no silver bullets, four interventions—redressing bias in the workforce, improving retention rates, reskilling women into tech roles, and bolstering girls in STEM classes earlier in their educational process—can have a significant impact.</p>

<h2>A closer look: First drop-off—from primary and secondary education to university</h2>

<p>During primary and secondary education, there are no indications that girls lag behind boys in STEM classes. In fact, in Bulgaria, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden, girls slightly outperform boys in science and math tests.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="fed3d760-2698-4c47-b461-3ca477285ba5"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">7</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="fed3d760-2698-4c47-b461-3ca477285ba5" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">According to TIMSS and PISA test scores, standardized science and math tests conducted at different age levels across multiple European countries.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p>Despite this fact, there’s an 18-percentage-point drop in girls going into STEM disciplines when they go to university. The drop is even more dramatic—31 percentage points—when analyzing young women going into ICT disciplines (ICT is a subsegment of STEM that focuses on information science, computer science, and technology, fields that more closely match education requirements for those going into tech roles) (Exhibit 2). Worse, trend lines showed a small but steady decline of one to two percentage points in women STEM graduates from 2016–20. This is all the more discouraging because in some STEM disciplines, such as natural science, we are almost reaching gender parity.</p>

<p>There are two main reasons for these drop-offs. The first is that secondary-school girls get significantly less teacher, parental, and peer support than boys do for pursuing STEM careers.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="73a4b789-bec3-490d-b223-47310b918dae"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">8</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="73a4b789-bec3-490d-b223-47310b918dae" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Zacharias C.

<p>This drop-off has the potential to create a self-fulfilling downward cycle. With only 19 percent of ICT bachelor students being women, the resulting isolation is often another reason women drop out of these classes.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="8e3708b1-12f7-4681-b467-8eb7f1b43615"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">10</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="8e3708b1-12f7-4681-b467-8eb7f1b43615" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Zacharias C.

<h2>A closer look: Second drop-off—from university to the workforce</h2>

<p>Across multiple industries, the data shows another dispiriting and significant drop-off in the percentage of women who transition into tech roles after graduation. Only 23 percent of women STEM majors end up in tech roles, compared with 44 percent of men.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="bc67e35d-8e2d-41c7-b500-3a929a5f8b1d"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">11</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="bc67e35d-8e2d-41c7-b500-3a929a5f8b1d" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">The top nontech roles women STEM majors enter are project management, assistant professor/academia, business analyst, teacher, sales manager, account manager, business development manager, and researcher.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p>The distribution of women in specific tech roles across all companies also varies significantly (Exhibit 3). Their greatest participation rate as a percentage of available roles is in product design and management (46 percent) and in data engineering, science, and analytics (30 percent). Their lowest participation rates are in DevOps and cloud roles (8 percent) and compute and operations roles (15 percent).</p>

<p>The data is only slightly more promising when we consider women who work at tech companies. While 37 percent of people who work in European tech and tech-adjacent companies are women, with the highest share being in social networking companies (50 percent) and e-commerce businesses (46 percent), the broader pattern remains the same, with women as just 25 percent of those working in tech roles (Exhibit 4).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the current representation of women in tech is particularly concerning because the very roles where women have the lowest share are exactly those that will have the highest demand and impact in coming years. For example, while 19 percent of people in the software engineering and architecture functions overall are women, they are only 10 percent of the cloud solution architects and 13 percent of the Python developers, two roles with the highest demand in the job market, according to Eightfold AI analysis (Exhibit 5). Even as a new generation of advanced technologies—from low-code/no-code solutions to generative AI—becomes more common, we anticipate there will continue to be an important need for skilled engineers and developers to not just enhance and maintain those technologies but also develop the next <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech">generation of technologies</a> (for example, quantum, Web3, and trust architectures).</p>

<h3>Reframe: Enable women in tech to thrive at work</h3>

<p>Based upon our analysis, companies can increase the number of women in tech roles by 480,000 to one million by ensuring companies, and men in positions of influence, provide women with support so they can thrive today in today’s digital workforce.</p>

<p>Companies should start with a comprehensive plan that actively addresses the pain points and needs of women. Some 70 percent of women in tech, in fact, still feel like they need to work harder and prove themselves because of their gender.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="ef461e14-725f-49fb-bc5f-ef6c1b618f81"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">12</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="ef461e14-725f-49fb-bc5f-ef6c1b618f81" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline"><em>The state of gender equity in tech</em>, Web Summit, 2022.</span></span></span></a></span> Reducing <a href="/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number">isolation of women in tech</a> roles by ensuring multiple women are working in the same location can help, as does instituting broader support networks, supportive HR policies, and effective sponsorship.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="fa2c6410-ecb2-40e3-abd1-13bfcfefab93"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">13</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="fa2c6410-ecb2-40e3-abd1-13bfcfefab93" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Kevin Sneader and Lareina Yee, “<a href="/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number">One is the loneliest number</a>,” McKinsey, January 29, 2019.</span></span></span></a></span> Active sponsorship—often from men—in the form of advocating for women and opening doors to sponsors’ networks, in fact, increases the chances that women’s ideas are heard (by 70 percent) and are likely to be implemented (by 200 percent).<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="e7778516-8393-4899-88ce-25df3261e638"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">14</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="e7778516-8393-4899-88ce-25df3261e638" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Sylvia Ann Hewlett and Laura Sherbin, <em>Athena Factor 2.0: Accelerating female talent in science, engineering, and technology</em>, Center for Talent Innovation, 2014.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<h3>Retain: Give women a reason to stay in tech</h3>

A recent Integrating Women Leaders Foundation study underscores this issue, finding that while 77 percent of executive men believe they are active allies for gender equality in their companies, only 45 percent of women executives agree.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="38fee8e9-14a8-4547-955d-c23aef6099b1"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">17</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="38fee8e9-14a8-4547-955d-c23aef6099b1" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline"><em>State of allyship-in-action benchmark study</em>, Integrating Women Leaders Foundation, July 2022.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p>Addressing this issue is complex, but an important element is developing effective <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/mining-for-tech-talent-gold-seven-ways-to-find-and-keep-diverse-talent">diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices</a>, such as strong assessment and measurement programs and accountability, and integrating them into the natural flow of business. That includes, for example, having KPIs for retaining women talent as part of the overall talent dashboard that leaders use (rather than making it a separate dashboard) and including retention goals for women as part of managers’ performance reviews.</p>

<p>The second issue is that women who aspire to better tech roles often feel they need to change employers. This is part of a broader trend: <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/human-capital-at-work-the-value-of-experience">McKinsey research</a> shows that more than 80 percent of role moves involve people moving from one employer to another, suggesting that changing employers is the route taken by most workers wanting to upgrade their roles.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="295c2cb8-5289-49ad-ab57-648d834e8310"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">18</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="295c2cb8-5289-49ad-ab57-648d834e8310" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">“<a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/human-capital-at-work-the-value-of-experience">Human capital at work: The value of experience</a>,” McKinsey Global Institute, June 2, 2022.

<h3>Redeploy: Ensure women are in tech roles that matter</h3>

<p>Companies can increase the number of women in tech roles by as much as 530,000 to 1.8 million by 2027 through a range of practices. These include <a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/overcoming-the-fear-factor-in-hiring-tech-talent">hiring women from untapped pools, training them in modern technologies (such as agile and MLOps), and building up their tech skills</a>.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="17ec7cee-0d56-4b99-998a-ec7fba0a441c"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">19</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="17ec7cee-0d56-4b99-998a-ec7fba0a441c" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">Davis Carlin, Anu Madgavkar, Dana Maor, and Angelika Reich, “<a href="/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/overcoming-the-fear-factor-in-hiring-tech-talent">Overcoming the fear factor in hiring talent</a>,” McKinsey Global Institute, August 31, 2022.</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<p>While this hiring aspiration represents the top threshold of potential in terms of pure numbers, the greater value is more in the quality of the shift rather than in the quantity of those making it. Many women, in fact, work in the fastest-declining tech roles, such as systems administrators and programmer analysts, which are also the roles that have been disproportionately affected by the recent waves of tech layoffs.<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__7oYio"><a data-testid="article-footnote" aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__jPMLi undefined " aria-describedby="639ff663-7543-4935-88a9-ab188bb4402b"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__J92bA">20</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__o7YSu"><span class="FootNote_notch__YLJf1"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__TEJxi mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__UTKy5"><span id="639ff663-7543-4935-88a9-ab188bb4402b" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__uOvzA mck-u-links-inline">McKinsey and Eightfold AI research.</span></span></span></a></span> Companies should focus on hiring and training women to assume tech roles that are gaining importance in the marketplace and society, such as product leads, machine learning engineers, and AI experts.</p>

<p>Companies could borrow a page from tech companies, where today about 44 percent of women in tech roles come from non-STEM educational backgrounds and learn on the job (Exhibit 7).</p>

<p>The full potential that can be unlocked by redeployment comes from three groups, totaling 270,000–850,000 women. The first is STEM-educated European women who have the most in-demand tech skills, such as SQL and Python, but are working in nontech roles (39 percent of this group). The second is European women who also possess these in-demand tech skills and are working in nontech roles (3 percent of this much larger group). And the third group is made up of European women with tech skills adjacent to those that are most in demand—for example, adjacent skills such as C++, Java, and Linux for top-rising skills such as Python.</p>

<p>One leading big-tech company is tapping this potential with an apprenticeship program to reskill and upskill traditionally overlooked talent pools such as single stay-at-home mothers. By combining in-class learning and hands-on engineering projects, the company has hired 98 percent of the women in its North American and African cohorts.</p>

<h3>Ramp up: Address STEM drop-off in university</h3>

<!-- -->

<p>Getting more girls to choose a STEM major is a great ambition, but it won’t help much, according to our analysis. Given current drop-off rates across bachelor’s degree programs, even if countries could increase the number of girls enrolling in STEM university classes by 1 percent (around 300,000 women), that would lead to only about 15,000 more women entering tech roles until 2027.</p>

<p>To drive significant change, programs supporting women already in university STEM classes can have the most impact. Providing more and better internship opportunities, mentoring and coaching women as they prepare to enter the workforce, and actively recruiting women to work on cutting-edge projects in leadership roles, among other programs, can help increase graduation rates for women in STEM and increase their overall numbers in tech by about 225,000–695,000, according to our analysis. The earlier drop-offs across primary and secondary education must also be addressed to fix the broken STEM rung in women’s tech career ladder over the long term.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Women can fix European tech’s talent challenge, but only if and when companies address the issues that keep more women from joining and staying in the tech workforce can Europe hope to build its competitive edge.</p></div><div class="container-placeholder"></div></div></div><div class="mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-gutter-xl"><section role="contentinfo" data-layer-region="article-about-authors" class="mdc-u-grid mdc-u-grid-col-md-12 AboutAuthor_mck-c-about-author__6XnRz"><div class="mdc-u-grid-col-md-start-2 mdc-u-grid-col-md-end-12 mdc-u-grid-col-lg-start-3 mdc-u-grid-col-lg-end-11"><h5 class="mdc-c-heading mdc-c-heading--title mdc-c-heading--border mdc-u-align-center"></h5><div class="mdc-c-description mdc-u-ts-8 mck-u-links-inline mck-u-links-inline--secondary mdc-u-mt-5"><div><p><strong><a href="/our-people/sven-blumberg">Sven Blumberg</a></strong> is a senior partner in McKinsey&rsquo;s D&uuml;sseldorf office, <strong>Melanie Krawina</strong> is a consultant in the Vienna office, <strong>Elina M&auml;kel&auml;</strong> is a consultant in the Helsinki office, and <strong><a href="/our-people/henning-soller">Henning Soller</a></strong> is a partner in the Frankfurt office.</p>

The analysis produced some interesting insights:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA significant drop in the percentage of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) classes happens at two points: during the transition from primary and secondary education to university, when it drops 18 percentage points, and during the transition from university to the workforce, when it drops another 15 (Exhibit 1).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile the rate of women working within tech \u003cem\u003ecompanies\u003c/em\u003e (such as social networks) is closer to parity, the rate of women working within tech \u003cem\u003eroles\u003c/em\u003e (such as developers and data engineers) is much lower.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe problem is likely to get worse. Women\u0026rsquo;s graduation rate in STEM disciplines during higher education is declining.[[footnote 6]] Furthermore, the share of women in the workforce is lowest in the tech roles that are growing fastest, such as DevOps and cloud. At current rates, the share of women in tech roles in Europe is heading toward a decline to 21 percent by 2027.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 1]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a tough problem to solve. However, although there are no silver bullets, four interventions\u0026mdash;redressing bias in the workforce, improving retention rates, reskilling women into tech roles, and bolstering girls in STEM classes earlier in their educational process\u0026mdash;can have a significant impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA closer look: First drop-off\u0026mdash;from primary and secondary education to university\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring primary and secondary education, there are no indications that girls lag behind boys in STEM classes. In fact, in Bulgaria, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden, girls slightly outperform boys in science and math tests.[[footnote 7]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this fact, there\u0026rsquo;s an 18-percentage-point drop in girls going into STEM disciplines when they go to university. The drop is even more dramatic\u0026mdash;31 percentage points\u0026mdash;when analyzing young women going into ICT disciplines (ICT is a subsegment of STEM that focuses on information science, computer science, and technology, fields that more closely match education requirements for those going into tech roles) (Exhibit 2). Worse, trend lines showed a small but steady decline of one to two percentage points in women STEM graduates from 2016\u0026ndash;20. This is all the more discouraging because in some STEM disciplines, such as natural science, we are almost reaching gender parity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two main reasons for these drop-offs. The first is that secondary-school girls get significantly less teacher, parental, and peer support than boys do for pursuing STEM careers.[[footnote 8]] Second, some research suggests that girls are told that they aren\u0026rsquo;t good at STEM, often communicated in subtle but debilitating behaviors, such as teachers in STEM classes calling on boys more than girls.[[footnote 9]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis drop-off has the potential to create a self-fulfilling downward cycle. With only 19 percent of ICT bachelor students being women, the resulting isolation is often another reason women drop out of these classes.[[footnote 10]] The silver lining in the data is that women\u0026rsquo;s graduation rates are on par with or slightly higher than men\u0026rsquo;s, suggesting that women who choose these disciplines are more likely than men to stick with them over the course of their higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[disruptor1up learnmore]]\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA closer look: Second drop-off\u0026mdash;from university to the workforce\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcross multiple industries, the data shows another dispiriting and significant drop-off in the percentage of women who transition into tech roles after graduation. Only 23 percent of women STEM majors end up in tech roles, compared with 44 percent of men.[[footnote 11]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe distribution of women in specific tech roles across all companies also varies significantly (Exhibit 3). Their greatest participation rate as a percentage of available roles is in product design and management (46 percent) and in data engineering, science, and analytics (30 percent). Their lowest participation rates are in DevOps and cloud roles (8 percent) and compute and operations roles (15 percent).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 3]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data is only slightly more promising when we consider women who work at tech companies. While 37 percent of people who work in European tech and tech-adjacent companies are women, with the highest share being in social networking companies (50 percent) and e-commerce businesses (46 percent), the broader pattern remains the same, with women as just 25 percent of those working in tech roles (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 4]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the current representation of women in tech is particularly concerning because the very roles where women have the lowest share are exactly those that will have the highest demand and impact in coming years. For example, while 19 percent of people in the software engineering and architecture functions overall are women, they are only 10 percent of the cloud solution architects and 13 percent of the Python developers, two roles with the highest demand in the job market, according to Eightfold AI analysis (Exhibit 5). Even as a new generation of advanced technologies\u0026mdash;from low-code/no-code solutions to generative AI\u0026mdash;becomes more common, we anticipate there will continue to be an important need for skilled engineers and developers to not just enhance and maintain those technologies but also develop the next \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech\"\u003egeneration of technologies\u003c/a\u003e (for example, quantum, Web3, and trust architectures).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 5]]\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe way forward: Four interventions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRedressing this imbalance is not easy, and no single solution has emerged. But four intervention strategies could have a big effect (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 6]]\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReframe: Enable women in tech to thrive at work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased upon our analysis, companies can increase the number of women in tech roles by 480,000 to one million by ensuring companies, and men in positions of influence, provide women with support so they can thrive today in today\u0026rsquo;s digital workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies should start with a comprehensive plan that actively addresses the pain points and needs of women. Some 70 percent of women in tech, in fact, still feel like they need to work harder and prove themselves because of their gender.[[footnote 12]] Reducing \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number\"\u003eisolation of women in tech\u003c/a\u003e roles by ensuring multiple women are working in the same location can help, as does instituting broader support networks, supportive HR policies, and effective sponsorship.[[footnote 13]] Active sponsorship\u0026mdash;often from men\u0026mdash;in the form of advocating for women and opening doors to sponsors\u0026rsquo; networks, in fact, increases the chances that women\u0026rsquo;s ideas are heard (by 70 percent) and are likely to be implemented (by 200 percent).[[footnote 14]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eImproving flexibility at work can have a profound effect on addressing women\u0026rsquo;s needs as well. Around 7 percent of European women (versus 0.5 percent of men) are out of the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities at home, and almost one in four women cite lack of work\u0026ndash;life balance as a key reason for leaving tech careers.[[footnote 15]] Offering remote or hybrid working programs, flexible working hours, and on-site childcare, for example, can make a big difference. One European entertainment company found that offering a \u0026ldquo;work from everywhere\u0026rdquo; policy lowered its attrition rates by 15 percent and increased women leaders from 25 percent to 42 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[disruptor1up readnext]]\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRetain: Give women a reason to stay in tech\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver half of women in tech leave the industry by the midpoint of their career\u0026mdash;more than double the rate of men\u0026mdash;resulting in many fewer women reaching leadership roles.[[footnote 16]] By improving the retention of women, European businesses could increase the number of women in tech by 370,000 to 440,000, according to our analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch shows that women cite two primary reasons for leaving. One is that companies do not provide them with strong management support and/or good opportunities. A recent Integrating Women Leaders Foundation study underscores this issue, finding that while 77 percent of executive men believe they are active allies for gender equality in their companies, only 45 percent of women executives agree.[[footnote 17]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAddressing this issue is complex, but an important element is developing effective \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/mining-for-tech-talent-gold-seven-ways-to-find-and-keep-diverse-talent\"\u003ediversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices\u003c/a\u003e, such as strong assessment and measurement programs and accountability, and integrating them into the natural flow of business. That includes, for example, having KPIs for retaining women talent as part of the overall talent dashboard that leaders use (rather than making it a separate dashboard) and including retention goals for women as part of managers\u0026rsquo; performance reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second issue is that women who aspire to better tech roles often feel they need to change employers. This is part of a broader trend: \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/human-capital-at-work-the-value-of-experience\"\u003eMcKinsey research\u003c/a\u003e shows that more than 80 percent of role moves involve people moving from one employer to another, suggesting that changing employers is the route taken by most workers wanting to upgrade their roles.[[footnote 18]] While reasons for switching employers vary, offering flexible career pathways and proactively working with women to explore new tech paths in their career development can help organizations retain more women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRedeploy: Ensure women are in tech roles that matter\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can increase the number of women in tech roles by as much as 530,000 to 1.8 million by 2027 through a range of practices. These include \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/overcoming-the-fear-factor-in-hiring-tech-talent\"\u003ehiring women from untapped pools, training them in modern technologies (such as agile and MLOps), and building up their tech skills\u003c/a\u003e.[[footnote 19]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this hiring aspiration represents the top threshold of potential in terms of pure numbers, the greater value is more in the quality of the shift rather than in the quantity of those making it. Many women, in fact, work in the fastest-declining tech roles, such as systems administrators and programmer analysts, which are also the roles that have been disproportionately affected by the recent waves of tech layoffs.[[footnote 20]] Companies should focus on hiring and training women to assume tech roles that are gaining importance in the marketplace and society, such as product leads, machine learning engineers, and AI experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies could borrow a page from tech companies, where today about 44 percent of women in tech roles come from non-STEM educational backgrounds and learn on the job (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 7]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe full potential that can be unlocked by redeployment comes from three groups, totaling 270,000\u0026ndash;850,000 women. The first is STEM-educated European women who have the most in-demand tech skills, such as SQL and Python, but are working in nontech roles (39 percent of this group). The second is European women who also possess these in-demand tech skills and are working in nontech roles (3 percent of this much larger group). And the third group is made up of European women with tech skills adjacent to those that are most in demand\u0026mdash;for example, adjacent skills such as C++, Java, and Linux for top-rising skills such as Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne leading big-tech company is tapping this potential with an apprenticeship program to reskill and upskill traditionally overlooked talent pools such as single stay-at-home mothers. By combining in-class learning and hands-on engineering projects, the company has hired 98 percent of the women in its North American and African cohorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRamp up: Address STEM drop-off in university\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eGetting more girls to choose a STEM major is a great ambition, but it won\u0026rsquo;t help much, according to our analysis. Given current drop-off rates across bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree programs, even if countries could increase the number of girls enrolling in STEM university classes by 1 percent (around 300,000 women), that would lead to only about 15,000 more women entering tech roles until 2027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo drive significant change, programs supporting women already in university STEM classes can have the most impact. Providing more and better internship opportunities, mentoring and coaching women as they prepare to enter the workforce, and actively recruiting women to work on cutting-edge projects in leadership roles, among other programs, can help increase graduation rates for women in STEM and increase their overall numbers in tech by about 225,000\u0026ndash;695,000, according to our analysis. The earlier drop-offs across primary and secondary education must also be addressed to fix the broken STEM rung in women\u0026rsquo;s tech career ladder over the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWomen can fix European tech\u0026rsquo;s talent challenge, but only if and when companies address the issues that keep more women from joining and staying in the tech workforce can Europe hope to build its competitive edge.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Authors":[{"id":"1c9d21f3-fc67-4426-8c3a-676fe8604551","url":"","name":"Sven Blumberg","displayName":"Sven Blumberg","fields":{"Profile":[{"id":"f027c3a2-903b-41bc-9604-86b08292cc42","url":"/our-people/sven-blumberg","name":"Sven Blumberg","displayName":"Sven Blumberg","fields":{"Independent Image":{"value":{}},"Standard Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/our people/sven blumberg/sven-blumberg_00816_fc-mask_profile_1536x1152.png","alt":"Sven Blumberg","width":"1536","height":"1152","Description":""}},"Thumbnail Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/our people/sven blumberg/sven-blumberg_00816_fc-mask_headshot_988x741.png","alt":"Sven Blumberg","width":"988","height":"741","Description":""}},"Full Bleed Image":{"value":{}},"Hero Mode":"{3F236DEE-C56F-43BE-91FF-F50543B48857}","Card Background":{"value":""},"Card Background Header":{"value":""},"Additional Expertise":{"value":""},"About Name":{"value":"Sven"},"Background":{"value":"\u003ch3\u003ePublished Work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/women-in-tech-the-best-bet-to-solve-europes-talent-shortage\"\u003eWomen in tech: The best bet to solve Europe\u0026rsquo;s talent shortage\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo;

You can\u0026rsquo;t be good at just one aspect of talent management and expect to succeed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFulfilling your tech-talent needs is increasingly a multifaceted contest. Finding great talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t help if the talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to work for you, and hiring great talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the talent leaves quickly. Companies have to invest simultaneously across the entire \u0026ldquo;hire to retire\u0026rdquo; life cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat starts with developing a digital-talent engine, a focused team dedicated to managing the entire employee experience, from hiring and onboarding to creating new career paths and continuously building skills. One large agricultural company established a digital-talent engine, which focused on modernizing talent sourcing by using contract-to-hire agreements and leveraging new digital channels (such as Topcoder), including coding exercises in candidate interviews, and implementing a candidate-tracking system to manage the hiring journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key activities of this more holistic approach to talent can be broken down into three areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorkforce:\u003c/em\u003e Develop a clear and surgical understanding of your talent gaps, a practical plan to fill them, and a hiring approach centered on candidate experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWork model:\u003c/em\u003e Put in place a work model that enables small teams of engineers to work on the most interesting problems unfettered by layers of management.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorkplace:\u003c/em\u003e Create a work environment that nurtures talent through diversity and a supportive culture, which is especially important within the context of hybrid and remote models.

That\u0026rsquo;s often because companies\u0026rsquo; talent analysis stops at the role level rather than probing what skills their people actually have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one digital-attacker bank did a detailed assessment of its talent, for example, it was shocked to find that only 35 percent of its senior tech talent had the skills the bank needed, and more than 50 percent of the talent required significant, systematic capability building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkforce planning also needs to happen much more frequently than the typical once or twice a year in order to keep pace with changing demands and shifts in the makeup of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Think candidate experiences, not recruiting process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo improve recruiting, HR departments and hiring managers tend to focus on improving their recruiting processes and introducing efficiencies. A more effective approach is to \u0026ldquo;think like a recruit\u0026rdquo; and focus on the candidate experience. That includes improving the virtual candidate experience, since 70 percent of companies in a recent survey said their recruiting and onboarding was at least half virtual.[[footnote 7]] Ways of doing that include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eTech talent wants to meet other technologists, so make sure that engineers and other relevant roles are part of your interview team. Bring your best people to interviews, online events, and conferences.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eGood candidates are ambitious and have many options. Develop an interview and evaluation approach that can lead to a decision in as little as one day. Before candidates even come through the door, assess their skills with tools such as HackerRank.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003ePost and pray is not a strategy. Tech talent isn\u0026rsquo;t just going to job sites, so be active in nontraditional channels, such as hackathons, open-source channels, and specific curated sites for different skills. For some companies, GitHub is their best recruiting channel.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eTop talent is eager to get going, so when new hires show up to start work, make sure there is an onboarding point of contact to help them navigate the company. The onboarding process should be streamlined so that, by the end of week one, developers are able to commit code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eAn entertainment company revamped the candidate experience by reducing the steps in the process, creating clarity on the bar for each role, and ensuring that engineers conducted the interviews. These three shifts reduced their \u0026ldquo;first-touch-to-offer\u0026rdquo; time from more than 90 days to fewer than ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Top talent is interviewing you, not the other way around\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would tech rock stars want to work for you? While money is important, top candidates care about working with newer technologies, building up their skills, being part of a culture that values technology, connecting with a purpose they find meaningful, and, most importantly, working on interesting and inspiring problems. The CIO of a leading European online marketplace, in fact, chose Scala over Java because that was tech talent\u0026rsquo;s preference at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe employee value proposition (EVP) is critical in addressing these points. One European public-sector institution was having trouble filling 400 tech roles. It refocused its EVP on its mission to work for the \u0026ldquo;greater good,\u0026rdquo; such as establishing digital services for all citizens, improving the citizen experience, and making services provided by the administration faster and more reliable. It was able to significantly increase the number of applications received and thus shorten the process to fill positions to a matter of weeks rather than the many months it used to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EVP needs to be backed up \u0026ldquo;on the ground\u0026rdquo; with programs and a culture that explicitly deliver on the promise. If talent sees that there is a disconnect between the stated EVP and the reality on the ground, they\u0026rsquo;re quick to leave and, worse, tell others. That can be devastating, because the most common way job seekers learn about companies is by reading company reviews from third-party sites, such as Glassdoor or Blind.[[footnote 8]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e5. You can\u0026rsquo;t hire or outsource your way out of your talent problems\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with relying on hiring is that often there is a significant lag time before someone becomes productive as well as there being a general shortfall of qualified talent. Similarly, \u003ca href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-reset-the-it-talent-model/\"\u003ecore capabilities need to remain in house to enable the business to move quickly\u003c/a\u003e, so outsourcing can\u0026rsquo;t be the main answer either. The reality is that much of the talent you need will have to come from within the organization. Your workforce planning should identify the appropriate balance between building skills internally, hiring externally, and outsourcing (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eTo build up skills internally, top companies move past traditional and subscale programs to make training both continuous (through ongoing learning journeys) and tailored (with learning programs created for specific roles and job families); see Exhibit 2 for an example of such a learning journey. They place an emphasis on building experience rather than simply providing certifications. Effective reskilling is based on a clear understanding of what existing skills will best translate into new skills. For example, project managers don\u0026rsquo;t tend to make good scrum masters, while a motivated mainframe engineer can often learn new technology stacks and languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\u003ch2\u003eWork model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e6.

But many of these top engineers can\u0026rsquo;t work in traditional organizations where a surfeit of managers and bureaucratic processes inhibit them from doing good work at pace. In many organizations, the ratio of engineers to management and coordination and support people is 30:70; that needs to be flipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTech leaders reshape their IT organizations around \u003ca href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-reset-the-it-talent-model/\"\u003esmall squads\u003c/a\u003e to create highly motivated, self-managing, agile teams.

It gave the team a broad charter to reinvent the onboarding process and protected them from most of the red tape. The team designed a compelling client journey and developed a groundbreaking technology that connected to each client\u0026rsquo;s human-resource information system (HRIS). It uploaded employee information, automatically determined insurability, and onboarded employees into the new plan. This approach helped the insurer close its first multimillion-dollar sale only four months after it was launched. In addition, the team members embraced the experience and became champions of the new way of working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e7. Eliminate meaningless toil and bad practices\u0026mdash;top talent won\u0026rsquo;t put up with it\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0026rsquo;t hire virtuoso jazz pianists and have them just practice scales all day. In the same way, top tech talent needs a work environment where they can fully practice their craft. Leading organizations focus on eliminating as many barriers as possible for their top coders. They invest, for example, in developing high-quality, reusable code and provide world-class planning and development tools to make engineers\u0026rsquo; work lives easier. They strive to make more than 80 percent of testing automated and continuous\u0026mdash;with \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/when-code-is-king-mastering-automotive-software-excellence\"\u003edevelopment done only after test cases are written\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eState-of-the-art production and preproduction environments are well integrated with development and testing environments, while best practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and working in the cloud, are the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading companies are also investing in low-code and no-code platforms that enable the average business user to develop applications without any software experience, freeing up seasoned developers to focus on the most challenging tasks.

Focus on developer happiness, and productivity and performance will follow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetaining top talent requires an environment where developers are treated like innovators, not code writers, and are \u003ca href=\"/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/unleashing-developers-full-talents-an-interview-with-twilios-ceo\"\u003eactive participants\u003c/a\u003e in the business. McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Organizational Health Index research, however, has shown that IT functions overall score well below the average in terms of organizational \u0026ldquo;health\u0026rdquo; (the ability to align around and execute strategic goals).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness leaders can reverse this situation by making the quality of the developer experience a primary metric of success and using data to closely track job satisfaction. Microsoft, for example, turned to calendaring data (among other sources of information), which revealed that in the company\u0026rsquo;s devices unit, management practices related to meetings were reducing engineers\u0026rsquo; job satisfaction.[[footnote 9]] One of the most important metrics is how many of your developers are recruiting other developers, because it signals how strongly your people believe in your company and its vision. So make referral programs transparent and efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth is also essential in building an engineering culture, and it can take many forms. Top engineers don\u0026rsquo;t want to just bang out features; they want to experiment with new code, become better developers, and follow passion projects, such as reducing tech debt or optimizing systems. Top companies build in extra buffer time to allow engineers to try new languages or tools that aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily \u0026ldquo;in scope.\u0026rdquo; By the same token, however, engineers expect clear targets and rapid feedback loops to let them know if they\u0026rsquo;re hitting their marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating an environment of \u0026ldquo;psychological safety\u0026rdquo; (where developers feel safe raising issues quickly, for example) is also an important element of an engineering culture and is the \u003ca href=\"/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance\"\u003enumber-one enabler in terms of technology\u0026rsquo;s impact on business performance\u003c/a\u003e. Tech leaders can role-model specific behaviors, such as demonstrating concern for team members as individuals rather than just employees and actively soliciting their input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e9. Stop turning great engineers into bad managers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t expect your engineers to aspire to become people managers. More than two-thirds of developers, in fact, don\u0026rsquo;t want to.[[footnote 10]] These experts instead prefer to keep their craft sharp and pursue ever more sophisticated digital challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this reason, digital organizations often have both managerial and non-managerial career paths for tech talent. Leading companies use lateral career moves to promote career growth and exciting career options. At Amazon, for example, people are encouraged to move across different products, channels, and/or roles to learn new skills and gain expertise in multiple areas of the business. Similarly, at Salesforce, it is common for engineers to move laterally across multiple products to gain experience. The technical track should be organized around clear \u0026ldquo;job architectures\u0026rdquo; and expectations for advancement at each level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e10. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are strategic necessities, not special initiatives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGender-diverse companies are \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003e25 percent more likely to financially outperform less diverse companies\u003c/a\u003e, while ethnically diverse companies are 36 percent more likely to do so. By the same token, technology talent expects a diverse work environment. We have found, in fact, that prized digital talent will often refuse a job offer or even refuse to apply to companies it perceives as noninclusive. One-third of recruiters say applicants are inquiring about DEI.[[footnote 11]] It\u0026rsquo;s worth asking: Does your leadership team reflect sufficient diversity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this challenge, DEI leaders put structural de-biasing mechanisms in place, such as making sure that DEI is continuously measured and decisions are reviewed\u0026mdash;for example, to track gender diversity in recruiting, retention, evaluation, and pay. They also define a clear technical career path and job structure for key talent pools, focusing on a well-structured path to first- and second-level manager positions.

Women leaders are switching jobs at the highest rates we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\u0026mdash;and at higher rates than men in leadership. That could have serious implications for companies. Women are already significantly underrepresented in leadership. For years, fewer women have risen through the ranks because of the \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; at the first step up to management. Now, companies are struggling to hold onto the relatively few women leaders they have. And all of these dynamics are even more pronounced for women of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe reasons women leaders are stepping away from their companies are telling. Women leaders are just as ambitious as men, but at many companies, they face headwinds that signal it will be harder to advance. They\u0026rsquo;re more likely to experience belittling microaggressions, such as having their judgment questioned or being mistaken for someone more junior. They\u0026rsquo;re doing more to support employee well-being and foster inclusion, but this critical work is spreading them thin and going mostly unrewarded. And finally, it\u0026rsquo;s increasingly important to women leaders that they work for companies that prioritize flexibility, employee well-being, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf companies don\u0026rsquo;t take action, they risk losing not only their current women leaders but also the next generation of women leaders. Young women are even more ambitious and place a higher premium on working in an equitable, supportive, and inclusive workplace. They\u0026rsquo;re watching senior women leave for better opportunities, and they\u0026rsquo;re prepared to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of this article summarizes the main findings from the \u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2022\u003c/em\u003e report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe state of the pipeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite modest gains in representation over the last eight years, women\u0026mdash;and especially women of color\u0026mdash;are still dramatically underrepresented in corporate America. And this is especially true in senior leadership: only one in four C-suite leaders is a woman, and only one in 20 is a woman of color (Exhibit 1). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20221]]\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, most companies are grappling with two pipeline problems that make achieving gender equality in their organizations all but impossible: \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. The \u0026lsquo;broken rung\u0026rsquo; remains unfixed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e For the eighth consecutive year, a broken rung at the first step up to manager is holding women back. For every 100 men who are promoted from entry-level roles to manager positions, only 87 women are promoted, and only 82 women of color are promoted (Exhibit 2). As a result, men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, and women can never catch up. There are simply too few women to promote to senior leadership positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20222]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. More women leaders are leaving their companies.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Now companies have a new pipeline problem. Women leaders are leaving their companies at the highest rate we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\u0026mdash;and at a much higher rate than men leaders. To put the scale of the problem in perspective: for every woman at the director level who gets promoted to the next level, two women directors are choosing to leave their company (Exhibit 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20223]]\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy women leaders are switching jobs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen leaders are demanding more from their companies, and they\u0026rsquo;re increasingly willing to switch jobs to get it. Three primary factors are driving their decisions to leave:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Women leaders want to advance, but they face stronger headwinds than men.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Women leaders are as likely as men at their level to want to be promoted and aspire to senior-level roles. In many companies, however, they experience microaggressions that undermine their authority and signal that it will be harder for them to advance. For example, they are far more likely than men in leadership to have colleagues imply that they aren\u0026rsquo;t qualified for their jobs. And women leaders are twice as likely as men leaders to be mistaken for someone more junior. Women leaders are also more likely to report that personal characteristics, such as their gender or being a parent, have played a role in them being denied or passed over for a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Story 20221]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Women leaders are overworked and underrecognized.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Compared with men at their level, women leaders do more to support employee well-being and foster DEI\u0026mdash;work that dramatically improves retention and employee satisfaction but is not formally rewarded in most companies. Indeed, 40 percent of women leaders say their DEI work isn\u0026rsquo;t acknowledged at all in performance reviews. Spending time and energy on work that isn\u0026rsquo;t recognized could make it harder for women leaders to advance. It also means that women leaders are stretched thinner than men in leadership; not surprisingly, 43 percent of women leaders are burned out, compared with only 31 percent of men at their level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e3. Women leaders are seeking a different culture of work.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women leaders are significantly more likely than men leaders to leave their jobs because they want more flexibility or because they want to work for a company that is more committed to employee well-being and DEI. And over the last two years, these factors have only become more important to women leaders: they are more than 1.5 times as likely as men at their level to have left a previous job because they wanted to work for a company that was more committed to DEI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe factors that prompt current women leaders to leave their companies are even more important to the next generation of women leaders. Young women care deeply about the opportunity to advance\u0026mdash;more than two-thirds of women under 30 want to be senior leaders. Young women are also more likely than current women leaders to say they\u0026rsquo;re increasingly prioritizing flexibility and company commitment to well-being and DEI (Exhibit 4).

As a result, these groups of women often experience more microaggressions and face more barriers to advancement. Notably, women of color are more ambitious despite getting less support: 41 percent of women of color want to be top executives, compared with 27 percent of White women. It\u0026rsquo;s critical that companies and coworkers are aware of these dynamics, so they can more effectively promote equity and inclusion for all women.

A vast majority of employees want to work for companies that offer remote- or hybrid-work options. Only 7 percent of companies plan to pull back on remote and hybrid work in the next year, and 32 percent say these options are likely to expand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eChoice is critical.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women employees  who can choose to work in the arrangement they prefer\u0026mdash;whether remote or on-site\u0026mdash;are less burned out, happier in their jobs, and much less likely to consider leaving their companies (Exhibit 5). This points to the importance of giving employees as much agency and choice when possible; a \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; approach to flexible work won\u0026rsquo;t work for all employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20225]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe option to work remotely is especially important to women. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eOnly one in ten women wants to work mostly on-site, and many women point to remote- and hybrid-work options as one of their top reasons for joining or staying with an organization. These preferences are about more than flexibility. When women work remotely at least some of the time, they experience fewer microaggressions and higher levels of psychological safety. The decrease in microaggressions is especially pronounced for women of color, LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities\u0026mdash;groups who typically face more demeaning and othering behavior (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;Remote-work options are especially critical for women with disabilities\u0026rdquo;). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 20221]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlthough remote and hybrid work are delivering real benefits, they may also be creating new challenges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Many employees\u0026mdash;and especially women employees\u0026mdash;are seeing important benefits from remote and hybrid work. Companies that offer flexible work options have also been able to diversify their talent pipelines; 71 percent of HR leaders say remote work has helped their organizations hire and retain more employees from diverse backgrounds. However, a majority of companies are concerned that employees who work remotely feel less connected to their teams and say that remote and hybrid work are placing additional demands on managers. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible that employees who work primarily from home\u0026mdash;who are more likely to be women\u0026mdash;will get fewer opportunities for recognition and advancement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemote and hybrid work can offer a reprieve from bias, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a substitute for systemic change. On one hand, it\u0026rsquo;s positive that women who work remotely are experiencing fewer microaggressions. On the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s deeply problematic. Regardless of where they work, all women deserve to feel valued and included. Companies cannot rely on remote and hybrid work as a solution; they need to invest in creating a truly inclusive culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs companies continue to navigate this transition, there are three key things they should consider. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Story 20223]]\n\u003ch3\u003eFive steps companies can take to navigate the shift to remote and hybrid work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not enough to tweak old policies and practices; companies that are transitioning to remote and hybrid work need to fundamentally rethink how work is done. To start, companies would be well served to focus their efforts in five areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Clearly communicate plans and guidelines for flexible work. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAs remote- and hybrid-work policies continue to evolve, it\u0026rsquo;s important for companies to share guidelines about who can work remotely and why so people don\u0026rsquo;t feel they\u0026rsquo;re being treated unfairly. It\u0026rsquo;s also important that companies provide clear guidelines to help employees navigate the day-to-day complexities of remote and hybrid work\u0026mdash;for example, by establishing specific windows during which meetings can be scheduled and employees in different time zones are expected to be available.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e2. Gather regular feedback from employees. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnly about half of companies have surveyed employees on their preferences for remote and hybrid work over the past year. As companies roll out new remote- and hybrid-work norms, they will want to keep a regular pulse on what\u0026rsquo;s working for employees and what needs to be improved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Invest in fostering employee connectedness.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e This means being intentional about working norms\u0026mdash;for example, having everyone join meetings via videoconference so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier for employees to participate when they are working remotely. It also means finding new ways to foster camaraderie and connection, such as making creative use of technology to facilitate watercooler-style interactions and team celebrations. Companies could also benefit from dedicating resources to team bonding events and, whether they\u0026rsquo;re virtual or in person, taking special care to make sure that all employees feel included and that events are accessible to everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Be purposeful about in-person work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Many employees don\u0026rsquo;t want to come into the office to do work they can just as easily do at home. In light of this, many companies are starting to refocus in-person work on activities that take advantage of being together, such as high-level planning, learning and development training, and bursts of heavy collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Make sure the playing field is level.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e It\u0026rsquo;s important that employees who choose remote- or hybrid-work options get the same support and opportunities as on-site employees. Managers play a central role here, and many could benefit from additional training on how to foster remote and hybrid employees\u0026rsquo; career development and minimize flexibility stigma. Equal access to mentorship and sponsorship is also key, yet less than half of companies offer virtual mentorship and sponsorship programs. Finally, companies can put safeguards in place to ensure employees who take advantage of remote- and hybrid-work options aren\u0026rsquo;t disadvantaged in performance reviews. This means communicating to managers that employees should be evaluated based on measurable results\u0026mdash;not when or where they work\u0026mdash;and closely tracking performance ratings and promotions for remote, hybrid, and on-site employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe importance of managers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers play an essential role in shaping women\u0026rsquo;s\u0026mdash;and all employees\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;work experiences. When managers invest in people management and DEI, women are happier and less burned out. They\u0026rsquo;re also more likely to recommend their company as a good place to work and less likely to think about leaving their jobs, which translates to better recruiting and higher retention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpectations of managers have risen over the past two years: the shift to remote and hybrid work has made management more challenging, and a majority of HR leaders say their company now expects managers to do more to promote inclusion and support employees\u0026rsquo; career development and well-being. But relatively few companies are training managers adequately to meet these new demands, and even fewer recognize DEI work and good people management in managers\u0026rsquo; performance reviews. This disconnect is apparent in the way managers show up. Only about half of women say their manager regularly encourages respectful behavior on their team, and less than half say their manager shows interest in their career and helps them manage their workload (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20226]]\n\u003ch3\u003eHow companies can equip, motivate, and reward good managers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin to close the gap between what\u0026rsquo;s expected of managers and how they show up, companies could focus on two key objectives:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Give managers more training and support. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAlthough a majority of companies provide general training for managers, far fewer address specifics that are critical to managing teams today, such as how to minimize burnout and ensure promotions are equitable. Research shows that when training focuses on concrete topics like these, it leads to better results.[[Footnote 3]] Companies could also benefit from stepping back to make sure people managers have the time and resources they need to do their jobs well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Hold managers accountable and reward those who excel. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s increasingly common for employees to review their manager\u0026rsquo;s performance, and prompts to gather more expansive input can be added to employee evaluation forms. Many companies track attrition rates, promotion rates, and other career outcomes and conduct surveys to measure employee satisfaction and well-being. Insights from these processes can be built into managers\u0026rsquo; performance evaluations. In addition, companies can take steps to signal their expectations and reward results more clearly, such as by sharing well-being and diversity metrics with all employees and publicly acknowledging managers who stand out for their efforts to support employees and foster inclusion on their teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRecommendations for companies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make meaningful and sustainable progress toward gender equality, companies should consider focusing on two broad goals: getting more women into leadership and retaining the women leaders they already have. That will require pushing beyond common practices. Companies with better representation of women, especially women of color, are going further. For example, they\u0026rsquo;re doubling down on setting goals and holding leaders accountable. They\u0026rsquo;re offering more specific and actionable training so that managers are better equipped to support their teams. And they\u0026rsquo;re offering a constellation of benefits to improve women\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day work experiences including, flexibility, emergency childcare benefits, and mental-health support. Companies that want to see better results would benefit from following their lead and break new ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost companies also need to take specific, highly targeted steps to fix their broken rung. This starts with identifying where the largest gap in promotions is for women in their pipeline. Then companies need to make sure women and men are put up for promotions at similar rates, monitor outcomes to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re equitable, and root out biased aspects of their evaluation process. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen implementing new policies and programs, companies can ensure they don\u0026rsquo;t simply \u0026ldquo;check the box.\u0026rdquo; Programs should be high-quality\u0026mdash;research shows that in some areas, low-quality programs can be more harmful than doing nothing at all.[[Footnote 4]] And companies should evaluate the impact of programs to assess whether benefits are equitable and identify areas where certain groups may need more targeted support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on an analysis of HR and DEI best practices, we have highlighted select policies and programs that are more prevalent in companies that have a higher representation of women and women of color (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20227]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe COVID-19 crisis and racial reckoning of 2020 pushed corporate America to reimagine the way we work.

They are also more likely to be allies to women of color. Yet this critical work is going unrecognized and unrewarded by most companies, and that has concerning implications.

Additionally, the gains in representation for women overall haven\u0026rsquo;t translated to gains for women of color. Women of color continue to lose ground at every step in the pipeline\u0026mdash;between the entry level and the C-suite, the representation of women of color drops off by more than 75 percent.

The COVID-19 crisis shook the economy and turned people\u0026rsquo;s lives upside down, both at work and at home. A heightened focus on racism and racial violence triggered a reckoning on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Companies\u0026rsquo; current priorities reflect these changes: an overwhelming majority of companies say that managers\u0026rsquo; efforts to promote employee well-being are critically important and that DEI is one of their key areas of focus. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen leaders are meeting this moment and taking on the work that comes with it (Exhibit 5). They are doing more than men in similar positions in supporting the people on their teams\u0026mdash;for example, by helping team members navigate work\u0026ndash;life challenges, ensuring that their workloads are manageable, and checking in on their overall well-being. Women leaders also spend more time than men on DEI work that falls outside their formal job responsibilities, such as supporting employee resource groups and recruiting employees from underrepresented groups. Senior-level women are twice as likely as senior-level men to dedicate time to these tasks at least weekly. And finally, women leaders are showing up as more active allies to women of color. They are more likely than men to educate themselves about the challenges that women of color face at work, to speak out against discrimination, and to mentor or sponsor women of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20215]]\n\u003cp\u003eWhen managers support employee well-being and companies prioritize DEI, employees are happier, less burned out, and less likely to consider leaving their jobs.

These experiences can take a heavy toll: women who regularly experience microaggressions are twice as likely as those who don\u0026rsquo;t to be burned out, more than twice as likely to report feeling negatively about their job, and almost three times as likely to say that in the past few months they have   struggled to concentrate at work as a result of stress. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar leaders]]\n\u003cp\u003eWomen of color not only still face higher rates of microaggressions, they also still lack active allies.

But for women of color and women with other traditionally marginalized identities, these experiences are more frequent and reflect a wider range of biases (Exhibit 6). For example, Black women are almost four times as likely as White women\u0026mdash;and Latinas and Asian women are two to three times as likely\u0026mdash;to hear people express surprise at their language skills or other abilities, and we see a similar pattern for other common microaggressions, as well.  \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20216]]\n\u003cp\u003eLGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities are also significantly more likely than women overall to experience microaggressions.

Although White employees recognize that speaking out against discrimination is critical, they are less likely to recognize the importance of more proactive, sustained steps such as advocating for new opportunities for women of color and stepping up as mentors and sponsors.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20217]]\n\u003ch3\u003eWomen who are \u0026lsquo;Onlys\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;double Onlys\u0026rsquo; have a much worse experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who are \u0026ldquo;Onlys\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;meaning, they are often one of the only people of their race or gender in the room at work\u0026mdash;have especially difficult day-to-day experiences. Onlys stand out, and because of that, they tend to be more heavily scrutinized. Their successes and failures are often put under a microscope, and they are more likely to encounter comments and behavior that reduce them to negative stereotypes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only for one dimension of identity is already incredibly difficult. But women of color sometimes have to contend with being Onlys on two dimensions: both as the only woman in the room and as the only person of their race in the room. \u0026ldquo;Double Onlys\u0026rdquo; face even more bias, discrimination, and pressure to perform, and they are even more likely to be experiencing burnout. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only or double Only can dramatically compound other challenges women are facing at work. Mothers of young children are one example of this\u0026mdash;they already face more bias and barriers than fathers and women overall, and when they are often the only woman in the room in their workplace, their experience is even more difficult. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared with mothers of young children who regularly work with other women, those who are Onlys are significantly more likely to experience burnout or to consider leaving their companies. They are also more likely to feel judged or to be worried about how their career might be affected if they take advantage of options that make it easier to balance work and life, such as working from home or working nonstandard hours. And they are less likely to feel comfortable sharing their personal challenges with colleagues, which means they\u0026rsquo;re less likely to get the support they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The road to progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we have seen important gains since 2016, women are still significantly underrepresented at all levels of management. And on top of this, women continue to have a worse day-to-day experience at work. Women are more likely than men to have their competence questioned and their authority undermined, and women of color and other women with traditionally marginalized identities are especially likely to face disrespectful and \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; behavior. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo drive change, companies need to invest deeply in all aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This starts with taking bold steps to ensure that women of diverse identities are well represented, but diversity of numbers isn\u0026rsquo;t enough on its own. Companies also need to create a culture that fully leverages the benefits of diversity\u0026mdash;one in which women, and all employees, feel comfortable bringing their unique ideas, perspectives, and experiences to the table. When women are respected and their contributions are valued, they are more likely to be happy in their jobs and to feel connected to their coworkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough there are no quick fixes to these challenges, there are steps companies can and should take. First, they need to put more practices in place to ensure promotions are equitable. Companies are currently taking more steps to reduce bias in hiring, and they need to apply that same rigor to the performance review process. For example, less than half of companies provide bias training for employees involved in performance reviews, compared with two-thirds that do so for hiring. Expanding this training would likely lead to better promotion outcomes for women and other employees from underrepresented groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, companies need to track representation and hiring and promotion outcomes more fully. Although most companies track representation for women overall, far fewer do this for women of color, which means women of color are often overlooked in diversity metrics. Companies would also be well-served to track hiring and promotions to determine whether women, and especially women of color, are being hired and promoted at similar rates to other employees. If they see gaps at particular levels or in certain functions, they may need to make adjustments, including doubling down on best practices in those areas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo accelerate progress for all women, on all fronts, companies need to double their efforts when it comes to accountability. Despite saying that gender and racial diversity are among their most important business priorities,  only two-thirds of companies hold senior leaders accountable for progress on diversity goals, and less than a third hold managers\u0026mdash;who play a critical role in hiring and promotions decisions\u0026mdash;accountable. Moreover, among companies that say they hold leaders accountable, less than half factor progress on diversity metrics into performance reviews, and far fewer provide financial incentives for meeting goals. This means their accountability isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to material consequences\u0026mdash;and it\u0026rsquo;s therefore much less likely to produce results. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e How companies can make their workplaces more inclusive\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies still have work to do to create a culture that fully embraces and leverages diversity. HR leaders say that two things are critical to this effort: senior-level sponsorship and high employee engagement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior leaders need to fully and publicly support DEI efforts. When senior-level employees model inclusive leadership and actively participate in training and events related to DEI, they send a powerful signal about the importance of this work. Senior leaders also play a key role in ensuring that DEI initiatives are appropriately resourced across their organizations. This is just another reason why it is critically important to hold leaders accountable for progress on DEI efforts and to formalize this accountability. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut women\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day experiences are shaped primarily by their interactions with managers and colleagues, which means that deep cultural change is possible only if all employees are empowered to be part of the solution. This starts with raising awareness. Employees need to understand the barriers that women face\u0026mdash;particularly women with traditionally marginalized identities\u0026mdash;and the benefits of a more inclusive culture. Companies can promote awareness by sharing data on the experiences of women in their organizations, bringing in thought-provoking speakers, and encouraging employees to openly share their experience and ideas for advancing DEI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor employees to move from awareness to action, training is an important step. The number of employees who receive training on bias, antiracism, and allyship is on the rise\u0026mdash;but only 34 percent of employees have received antiracism training in the past year, and just 14 percent have received allyship training. This suggests that companies may need to take bolder steps to encourage participation, such as offering incentives or making training mandatory. They should also invest in ongoing employee education; it takes consistent reinforcement to reshape deep-rooted biases and change behavior, so a one-and-done approach to training is not enough. And companies need to be sure that they are incorporating the new ideas and tools from training into everyday processes, too. For example, before hiring and promotion processes begin, companies can send out reminders about how bias can influence evaluations; research shows that this simple practice can improve outcomes for women and other people from underrepresented groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, companies should clearly communicate what is expected of employees and what it means to have an inclusive culture. Building this thinking into company values is a good place to start, but organizations would benefit from articulating the specific behaviors and actions that promote inclusion. In addition to signaling the importance of this work, clear guidelines will help set managers and all employees up for success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e How companies can begin to address burnout\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies have demonstrated strong commitment to employee well-being over the past year. They have taken a wide range of steps to help employees weather the pandemic, including increasing mental-health benefits, adding support for parents and caregivers, and offering more paid leave. These steps have led to better outcomes for all employees, and they have likely played a key role in allowing many women to remain in the workforce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, burnout is still on the rise, especially among women. There is no easy fix, so continued investment will be critical. Companies also should look for opportunities to expand on the successful policies and programs they have already established and try new approaches. It\u0026rsquo;s also important that companies establish new norms and systems to improve employees\u0026rsquo; everyday work experiences\u0026mdash;even with all the right policies and programs, employees will continue to struggle if the cadence and expectations of their work feel untenable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross all of their efforts to combat burnout, companies would benefit from embracing experimentation. There is no playbook for this unprecedented moment, but companies can make strides by listening closely to employees, exploring creative solutions, and trying something different if a new norm or program falls flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs companies embrace flexibility, they also need to set clear boundaries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past 18 months, companies have embraced flexibility. More than three-quarters of senior HR leaders say that allowing employees to work flexible hours is one of the most effective things they\u0026rsquo;ve done to improve employee well-being, and there are clear signs it\u0026rsquo;s working. Employees with more flexibility to take time off and step away from work are much less likely to be burned out, and very few employees are concerned that requesting flexible work arrangements has affected their opportunity to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, many companies are missing a crucial piece: without clear boundaries, flexible work can quickly turn into \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; work. More than a third of employees feel like they need to be available for work 24/7, and almost half believe they need to work long hours to get ahead. Employees who feel this way are much more likely to be burned out and to consider leaving their companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that so many employees feel \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; signals that companies need to define expectations more explicitly. Right now, many companies are leaving it to employees to establish their own boundaries when they work remotely or work flexible hours\u0026mdash;and while employees should be empowered to carve out personal time, companies have a responsibility to put formal boundaries in place across the organization. Only one in five employees says that their company has told them that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to respond to nonurgent requests outside of traditional work hours, and only one in three has received guidance around blocking off personal time on their calendar. Establishing or reinforcing work norms such as these would go a long way toward reducing the feeling of being always on.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[PullQuote 3]]\n\u003cp\u003eAs companies navigate the transition to increased remote and hybrid work\u0026mdash;with more employees working different schedules across different time zones\u0026mdash;the risk of feeling always on will likely increase. Establishing clear boundaries now can help companies ease this transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagers have an important role to play in fighting burnout\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers are on the front lines of employees\u0026rsquo; day-to-day experiences, which means their actions have a significant impact on employee burnout and well-being. To improve outcomes, managers should focus their attention in three key areas: modeling work\u0026ndash;life boundaries, supporting employee well-being, and ensuring that performance is evaluated based on results. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployees often look to their manager to understand unspoken company norms and expectations. This means that managers need to respect company-wide boundaries around flexible work. For example, if employees aren\u0026rsquo;t expected to respond to emails during certain hours, managers need to abide by that norm. Managers can further reinforce the importance of these norms by celebrating employees who push back when boundaries are crossed and by encouraging candid conversations and problem solving across the team if boundaries start to erode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo underscore that employees are not expected to be \u0026ldquo;always on,\u0026rdquo; companies and managers need to work together to make sure all employees are evaluated based on results rather than when or where they work. A results-oriented lens is critical in formal performance reviews, and managers should be mindful of the day-to-day feedback they deliver to ensure they aren\u0026rsquo;t inadvertently signaling that long hours and face time are unspoken measures of performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also important that managers actively monitor employees for signs of burnout and adjust workloads as needed. Although some managers are stepping up on this front\u0026mdash;especially women\u0026mdash;a majority of employees report that their manager doesn\u0026rsquo;t check in on their well-being or help them shift priorities and deadlines on a regular basis. This suggests that managers need to touch base with their teams more consistently, and that these check-ins should be more explicit. Prompting employees to rate their level of stress and exhaustion on a one-to-ten scale, as opposed to generally asking them how they\u0026rsquo;re doing, creates more space for open, honest discussion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, companies need to impress upon managers that the work they do to support employee well-being is critical to the health and success of the business. For this work to feel like a real priority, it needs to be tied to concrete outcomes for managers, including performance ratings and compensation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLooking ahead\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate challenge for companies is to help employees get through the pandemic\u0026mdash;and the work to get this right is far from over. But companies also need to start to plan for the future. The disruption of the past year and half is driving a fundamental change in the way people work. Companies are embracing flexibility and remote work at levels that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago\u0026mdash;and employees are fully on board. It will take time for the full impact of the pandemic to come into focus, but one thing is clear: hybrid work is here to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s unclear is whether companies can capitalize on this seismic shift\u0026mdash;and the growing cultural focus on employee well-being and racial equity\u0026mdash;to create more caring, connected, and inclusive workplaces. This is a rare opportunity to change the workplace for good. Doing so will require pushing for bigger gains in representation of women, recognizing and rewarding women\u0026rsquo;s contributions as people-focused leaders and champions of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and doing the deep cultural work necessary to create a workplace where all women, and all employees, feel like they belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will demand a level of investment and creativity that may not have seemed possible before the pandemic, but companies have shown what they can do when change is critical. Now, they need to treat women\u0026rsquo;s equality and diversity, equity, and inclusion with the same sense of urgency\u0026mdash;and they need to reward the leaders taking us into the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is an edited extract from Women in the Workplace 2021, a study undertaken by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org.

Under the highly challenging circumstances of \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis\"\u003ethe COVID-19 pandemic\u003c/a\u003e, many employees are struggling to do their jobs. Many feel like they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; now that the boundaries between work and home have blurred. They\u0026rsquo;re worried about their family\u0026rsquo;s health and finances. Burnout is a real issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen in particular have been negatively impacted. Women\u0026mdash;especially women of color\u0026mdash;are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis,[[footnote 5]] stalling their careers and jeopardizing their financial security. The pandemic has intensified challenges that women already faced. Working mothers have always worked a \u0026ldquo;double shift\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a full day of work, followed by hours spent caring for children and doing household labor. Now the supports that made this possible\u0026mdash;including school and childcare\u0026mdash;have been upended. Meanwhile, Black women already faced more barriers to advancement than most other employees.[[footnote 6]] Today they\u0026rsquo;re also coping with the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 \u003ca href=\"/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-investing-in-black-lives-and-livelihoods\"\u003eon the Black community\u003c/a\u003e. And the emotional toll of repeated instances of racial violence falls heavily on their shoulders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of these dynamics, more than one in four women are contemplating what many would have considered unthinkable just six months ago: downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce completely. This is an emergency for corporate America. Companies risk losing women in leadership\u0026mdash;and future women leaders\u0026mdash;and unwinding years of painstaking progress toward gender diversity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crisis also represents an opportunity. If companies make significant investments in building a more flexible and empathetic workplace\u0026mdash;and there are signs that this is starting to happen\u0026mdash;they can retain the employees most affected by today\u0026rsquo;s crises \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e nurture a culture in which women have equal opportunity to achieve their potential over the long term. The rest of this article summarizes the report\u0026rsquo;s main findings (and you can go even deeper with a \u003ca href=\"/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-are-working-women-doing-during-covid-19-our-women-in-the-workplace-study-explores\"\u003ebehind-the-scenes chat\u003c/a\u003e with one of the report\u0026rsquo;s coauthors on our blog).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP 1]]\n\u003ch2\u003eProgress toward gender parity remains slow \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 2020, the representation of women in corporate America was trending in the right direction. This was most pronounced in senior management: between January 2015 and January 2020, representation of women in senior-vice-president positions grew from 23 to 28 percent, and representation in the C-suite grew from 17 to 21 percent (Exhibit 1). Women remained dramatically underrepresented\u0026mdash;particularly women of color\u0026mdash;but the numbers were slowly improving.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit a]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe \u0026lsquo;broken rung\u0026rsquo; is still holding women back\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite gains for women in leadership, the \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; was still a major barrier in 2019. For the sixth year in a row, women continued to lose ground at the first step up to manager. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 85 women were promoted\u0026mdash;and this gap was even larger for some women: only 58 Black women and 71 Latinas were promoted. As a result, women remained significantly outnumbered in entry-level management at the beginning of 2020\u0026mdash;they held just 38 percent of manager-level positions, while men held 62 percent (Exhibit 2). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit b]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe COVID-19 crisis could set women back half a decade\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eBefore this year, Women in the Workplace research had consistently found that women and men leave their companies at comparable rates. However, due to the challenges created by the COVID-19 crisis, as many as two million women are considering leaving the workforce[[footnote 7]] . If these women feel forced to leave the workplace, we\u0026rsquo;ll end up with far fewer women in leadership\u0026mdash;and far fewer women on track to be future leaders. All the progress we\u0026rsquo;ve seen over the past six years could be erased (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;A closer look at the challenges that could force women out of the workforce\u0026rdquo;). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies are stepping up\u0026mdash;but many aren\u0026rsquo;t addressing the likely underlying causes of stress and burnout\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have taken important steps to support employees during the COVID-19 crisis. They are sharing valuable information with employees, including updates on the business\u0026rsquo;s financial situation and details about paid-leave policies. Almost all companies are providing tools and resources to help employees work remotely. Many have also expanded services related to mental health, such as counseling and enrichment programs, and offered training to help managers support employees\u0026rsquo; mental health and well-being. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, fewer companies have taken steps to adjust the norms and expectations that are most likely responsible for employee stress and burnout. Less than a third of companies have adjusted their performance review criteria to account for the challenges created by the pandemic, and only about half have updated employees on their plans for performance reviews or their productivity expectations during COVID-19. That means many employees\u0026mdash;especially parents and caregivers\u0026mdash;are facing the choice between falling short of pre-pandemic expectations that may now be unrealistic, or pushing themselves to keep up an unsustainable pace (Exhibit 3). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit c]]\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the issue of financial anxiety. Companies are putting policies and programs in place to ease employees\u0026rsquo; financial stress. More than half have increased paid leave\u0026mdash;which is an important option for employees who need time off but can\u0026rsquo;t afford to miss a paycheck\u0026mdash;and about a third have added or expanded stipends to offset the costs of working from home. However, companies that are struggling financially may not be able to address the issue employees are most concerned about: the possibility of being laid off or furloughed. Sadly, for companies struggling financially or rethinking their business, it may not be possible to reassure their employees on this front. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCOVID-19 could push many mothers out of the workforce\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecades of research shows that women do significantly more housework and childcare than men\u0026mdash;so much so that women who are employed full-time are often said to be working a \u0026ldquo;double shift.\u0026rdquo;[[footnote 8]] Now women, and mothers in particular, are taking on an even heavier load. Mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to be responsible for most of the housework and caregiving during the pandemic. In fact, they\u0026rsquo;re 1.5 times more likely than fathers to be spending an additional three or more hours per day on housework and childcare (Exhibit 4). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit d]]\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, for the one in five mothers who don\u0026rsquo;t live with a spouse or partner, the challenges are even greater. Unsurprisingly, single mothers are much more likely than other parents to do all the housework and childcare in their household, and they are also more likely to say that financial insecurity is one of their top concerns during the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOne in three mothers have considered leaving the workforce or downshifting their careers because of COVID-19\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the enormous challenges mothers are facing at work and at home, two things should come as no surprise: many mothers are considering downshifting their career or leaving the workforce, and mothers are significantly more likely to be thinking about taking these steps than fathers (Exhibit 5). Among mothers who are thinking about downshifting or leaving, a majority cite childcare responsibilities as a primary reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit e]]\n\u003ch2\u003e Companies are at risk of losing women in leadership\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior-level women are under the same pressure to perform right now as senior-level men\u0026mdash;and then some. Women are often held to higher performance standards than men, and they may be more likely to take the blame for failure\u0026mdash;so when the stakes are high, as they are now, senior-level women could face higher criticism and harsher judgement. Senior-level women are also nearly twice as likely as women overall to be \u0026ldquo;Onlys\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;the only or one of the only women in the room at work. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number\"\u003eThat comes with its own challenges\u003c/a\u003e: women who are Onlys are more likely than women who work with other women to feel pressure to work more and to experience microaggressions, including needing to provide additional evidence of their competence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, senior-level women are significantly more likely than men at the same level to feel burned out, under pressure to work more, and \u0026ldquo;as though they have to be \u0026lsquo;always on.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; And they are 1.5 times more likely than senior-level men to think about downshifting their role or leaving the workforce because of COVID-19. Almost three in four cite burnout as a main reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies can\u0026rsquo;t afford to lose women leaders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility of losing so many senior-level women is alarming for several reasons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe financial consequences could be significant. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003eResearch shows\u003c/a\u003e that company profits and share performance can be close to 50 percent higher when women are well represented at the top.[[footnote 9]] Beyond that, senior-level women have a vast and meaningful impact on a company\u0026rsquo;s culture. They are more likely than senior-level men to embrace employee-friendly policies and programs and to champion racial and gender diversity: more than 50 percent of senior-level women say they consistently take a public stand for gender and racial equity at work, compared with about 40 percent of senior-level men (Exhibit 6). And they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to mentor and sponsor other women: 38 percent of senior-level women currently mentor or sponsor one or more women of color, compared with only 23 percent of senior-level men. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf women leaders leave the workforce, women at all levels could lose their most powerful allies and champions. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit f]]\n\u003ch3\u003e Black women are less likely to feel supported at work during COVID-19\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women have always faced huge barriers to advancement. Now, in addition to the heightened pressures that Black women who are mothers and senior leaders are experiencing, they are also dealing with distinct issues because of their race. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected Black people, and incidents of violence toward Black people in the United States have exacted a heavy emotional and mental toll on Black women. On top of all this, many Black women do not feel supported by managers and coworkers (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit g]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe workplace has always been more unequal for Black women\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared with their colleagues of other races and ethnicities, Black women have always had distinct, and by and large worse, experiences at work. They are promoted more slowly than other groups of employees and are significantly underrepresented in senior leadership. They are less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to say their manager advocates for new opportunities for them. And they have fewer interactions with senior leaders, which means they often don\u0026rsquo;t get the sponsorship and advocacy they need to advance. Given these challenges, it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that Black women are less likely than employees of other races to report they have equal opportunity to advance at work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women also deal with more day-to-day bias in their workplaces. They face a wider range of microaggressions, from having their judgment questioned to hearing demeaning remarks about themselves or people like them. Additionally, half of Black women are often Onlys for their race. Black women who are Onlys are especially likely to feel scrutinized, under increased pressure to perform, and as if their actions reflect positively or negatively on people like them.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNow, Black women are facing even more challenges\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women are being disproportionately affected by the difficult events of 2020. They are more than twice as likely as women overall to say that the death of a loved one has been one of their biggest challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. And incidents of racial violence across the United States are exacting a heavy emotional toll. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, work would be a supportive place for Black women amid these national and global crises. Unfortunately, for many, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. Black women are less likely than women overall to report that their manager has inquired about their workload or taken steps to ensure that their work\u0026ndash;life needs are being met.[[footnote 10]] Fewer than one in three Black women report their manager has checked in on them in light of recent racial violence or \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/sustaining-and-strengthening-inclusion-in-our-new-remote-environment\"\u003efostered an inclusive culture\u003c/a\u003e on their team. Plus, Black women are far less likely than White colleagues to say they have strong allies at work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this is having an impact on Black women. They are more likely than employees of other races and ethnicities to feel uncomfortable talking with colleagues about the impact current events have had on their community and \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-hidden-perils-of-unresolved-grief\"\u003eabout their own grief and loss\u003c/a\u003e. They also feel more reluctant to share their thoughts on racial inequity. And compared with other employees, Black women feel more excluded at work and are less likely to say they can bring their whole selves to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow companies can better support Black women\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Video 2020]]\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women were already having a worse experience in the workplace than most other employees. Now they\u0026rsquo;re facing the same challenges other women are\u0026mdash;plus painful and isolating challenges rooted in racism. To better support Black women, companies need to take action in two critical areas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Address the distinct challenges of Black women head-on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to address the distinct experiences of Black women, who face obstacles rooted in both racism and sexism. The first step is making a public and explicit commitment to advancing and supporting Black women. This commitment should be communicated to employees, along with a clear explanation of why it\u0026rsquo;s important. Many employees don\u0026rsquo;t realize that Black women are having a markedly worse experience at work. But for six years, this study has shown this to be true: compared with women of other races and ethnicities, Black women face more systemic barriers, receive less support from managers, and experience more acute discrimination. If employees understand this, they will be more likely to champion the Black women in their organization. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo effectively turn their commitment into action, companies should adopt an intersectional approach to their diversity efforts. Many corporate diversity efforts focus on either race or gender, which means women of color may end up being overlooked. In contrast, when companies set goals and track outcomes by gender and race combined, they can more clearly see how Black women and other women of color are progressing. For example, if companies evaluate access to formal mentorship, sponsorship, and management training this way, Black women are more likely to get equal access to these critical opportunities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e2. Foster a culture that supports and values Black women\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to foster a culture in which Black women\u0026mdash;and other traditionally marginalized employees\u0026mdash;feel like they belong. There are two equally important parts of this: making it clear that disrespectful behavior won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated and taking proactive steps to make sure that Black women feel valued and welcome. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have specific guidelines for conduct that is not acceptable, which is a good first step. But it\u0026rsquo;s also important to articulate what positive, inclusive behavior looks like and celebrate examples of it in practice. Employees will be better equipped to do their part if they receive antiracism and allyship training; this will give them a more complete understanding of how to combat racial discrimination and how to show up for Black women as allies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to reflect on organizational customs, rituals, and norms to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re inclusive. For example, are Black women being included in informal gatherings? Are team events held in spaces where everyone feels welcome and safe? Gathering input from Black women on what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t working for them is critical to this process\u0026mdash;as is giving Black women a voice in shaping new company norms. The more that companies take into account the unique perspectives and experiences of different groups of employees, the more effectively they can create an inclusive culture. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The path forward\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choices companies make could shape the workplace for women for decades to come\u0026mdash;for better or for worse. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges facing companies right now are serious. Up to two million women are considering leaving the workforce. The \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; that held millions of women back from being promoted to manager has not been repaired. Black women are dealing with additional challenges\u0026mdash;including long-standing issues of racial bias\u0026mdash;and getting less support from managers and coworkers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two paths ahead. If companies recognize the scale of these problems and do all they can to address them, they can help their employees get through this difficult time and even reinvent the way they work so it\u0026rsquo;s more flexible and sustainable for everyone. If not, the consequences could badly hurt women, business, and the economy as a whole. This moment requires long-term thinking, creativity, strong leadership, and a laser focus on the value of women to their organizations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo retain the women most affected by the challenges of COVID-19, companies need to take steps to reduce the additional pressures they\u0026rsquo;re experiencing. Here are six key areas where companies should focus or expand their efforts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Make work more sustainable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sustainable pace of work is essential to helping mothers, senior-level women, and all employees facing burnout get through this crisis. To make this happen, leaders and managers need to look at productivity and performance expectations set before COVID-19 and ask if they\u0026rsquo;re still realistic. They may also need to reset goals, narrow project scopes, or keep the same goals and extend deadlines. Currently, only a small number of managers are doing this. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, companies have found creative ways to give employees extra time off. For example, we\u0026rsquo;ve heard from companies that have offered \u0026ldquo;COVID-19 days\u0026rdquo; to give parents a chance to prepare for the new school year and from companies that close for a few Fridays each quarter to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Reset norms around flexibility\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOVID-19 has made it much harder for employees to draw clear lines between work and home, and many employees feel like they are \u0026ldquo;always on.\u0026rdquo; Companies should look for ways to reestablish work\u0026ndash;life boundaries. For many, this may require setting new work norms\u0026mdash;for example, establishing set hours for meetings, putting policies in place for responding to emails outside typical business hours, and improving communication about work hours and availability within teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can also encourage employees to set their own boundaries and take full advantage of flexible work options. Even when these options are available, some employees worry there may be a stigma attached to using them. To mitigate this, leaders can assure employees that their performance will be measured based on results\u0026mdash;not when, where, or how many hours they work. Leaders can also communicate their support for workplace flexibility\u0026mdash;57 percent of employees say senior leaders at their company have done this during COVID-19. Better yet, leaders can model flexibility in their own lives, which sends a message to employees that it\u0026rsquo;s OK to take advantage of flexible work options. When employees believe senior leaders are supportive of their flexibility needs, they are less likely to consider downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Take a close look at performance reviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerformance reviews are an important part of running an effective organization and rewarding employees for their contributions. But given the shift to remote work and the heightened challenges employees are coping with in their personal lives, performance criteria set before COVID-19 may no longer be appropriate. Managers can relieve employees\u0026rsquo; stress\u0026mdash;and refocus on key priorities\u0026mdash;by reassessing performance criteria set before the pandemic to make sure those criteria are still attainable. Bringing criteria into line with what employees can reasonably achieve may help to prevent burnout and anxiety\u0026mdash;and this may ultimately lead to better performance and higher productivity.[[footnote 11]] \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Take steps to minimize gender bias\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic may be amplifying biases women have faced for years: higher performance standards, harsher judgment for mistakes, and penalties for being mothers and for taking advantage of flexible work options.[[footnote 12]] These biases could show up in new ways during COVID-19: for example, when colleagues see young children playing in the background on video calls; when coworkers assume, consciously or unconsciously, that women are less committed to their jobs; or when managers are evaluating women in performance reviews. Given that managers and team members now have less visibility into their colleagues\u0026rsquo; day-to-day work, they may be more likely to make assumptions about their performance, and this increases the chance of bias creeping in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo mitigate the biases that women are up against, companies need to make sure that employees are aware of them. Leaders and employees should speak publicly about the potentially outsize impact of bias during COVID-19. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity\"\u003eBias training\u003c/a\u003e can also help. In the past year, just one in four employees have participated in unconscious-bias training, and even employees who have participated in the past would benefit from a refresher. And finally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to track outcomes for promotions and raises by gender\u0026mdash;as well as the breakdown of layoffs and furloughs by gender\u0026mdash;to make sure women and men are being treated fairly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Adjust policies and programs to better support employees\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have extended policies and programs to support employees during COVID-19, from offering more paid time off to providing resources for homeschooling. Companies should make sure employees are aware of the full range of benefits available to them. Right now, there\u0026rsquo;s a significant gap between what companies offer and what employees are aware of. For example, almost all companies offer mental-health counseling, but only about half of employees know this benefit is available. The same trend holds for other valuable programs such as parenting resources, health checks, and bereavement counseling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs organizations settle into the next normal, they should determine how effectively they are addressing employees\u0026rsquo; biggest challenges and reallocate resources to the programs that are most valuable. Given how unprecedented this crisis is, they should also consider whether their benefits go far enough to support employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6) Strengthen employee communication\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen and frequent \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/communications-get-personal-how-leaders-can-engage-employees-during-a-return-to-work\"\u003ecommunication with employees is critical\u003c/a\u003e, especially in a crisis; when employees are surprised by decisions that have an impact on their work, they are three times more likely to be unhappy in their job. Yet one in five employees have consistently felt uninformed or in the dark during COVID-19. This suggests that companies should share more regular updates on the state of the business and key decisions that affect employees\u0026rsquo; work and lives\u0026mdash;and they should directly address what difficult news means for employees. It\u0026rsquo;s also critical that leaders and HR teams communicate with empathy, so employees feel valued and understood. Research shows that this kind of openness and understanding reduces anxiety and builds trust among employees.[[footnote 13]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The road to progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COVID-19 crisis has prompted companies to rethink fundamental beliefs about remote work. Ninety-three percent of companies now say more jobs can be performed remotely, and close to 70 percent predict a significant share of their employees will regularly work remotely a year from now. [[footnote 14]] Employees see the benefits of remote work, too\u0026mdash;almost eight in ten say they want to continue to work from home more often than they did before COVID-19. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the beginning of a seismic shift in the way we work, with enormous implications. Companies may be able to tap into larger and more diverse talent pools, as opposed to limiting their recruiting to specific regions. And they already anticipate these benefits: 70 percent think remote work will allow them to increase diversity in their hiring. Moreover, remote work will open up opportunities for existing employees\u0026mdash;particularly mothers, caregivers, older employees, and people with disabilities. If companies can create a culture \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/reimagining-the-postpandemic-workforce\"\u003ethat supports both in-person and remote workers\u003c/a\u003e, these employees will be able to take on jobs that previously would have required them to relocate, travel extensively, or manage a long commute. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe building blocks of a more empathetic workplace may also be falling into place\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have made \u003ca href=\"/industries/healthcare/our-insights/national-surveys-reveal-disconnect-between-employees-and-employers-around-mental-health-need\"\u003eemployee mental health and well-being\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;a much higher priority in the face of this crisis. Employees have more visibility than ever before into what\u0026rsquo;s going on in one another\u0026rsquo;s personal lives. And companies say that the crisis has created a feeling of solidarity and fostered empathy and understanding among employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaken together, these dynamics point to an increased focus on supporting employees as \u0026ldquo;whole people.\u0026rdquo; And when employees feel like they can bring their whole selves to work, good things happen: they are happier with their job, more optimistic about their company\u0026rsquo;s commitment to gender and racial equality, and less likely to consider downshifting their role or leaving the workforce. They\u0026rsquo;re also more comfortable sharing challenges with managers and coworkers, giving companies the visibility to make changes that improve employees\u0026rsquo; experiences. It\u0026rsquo;s a positive cycle: the more employees can bring their whole selves to work, the more the workplace will work for them\u0026mdash;and for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is an edited extract from Women in the Workplace 2020, a study undertaken by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org.

But companies need to focus their efforts earlier in the pipeline to make real progress.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year marks the fifth year\u003c/strong\u003e of our research on Women in the Workplace, conducted in partnership with LeanIn.Org. We look back on data and insights since 2015 from close to 600 companies that participated in the study, more than a quarter of a million people that were surveyed on their workplace experiences, and more than 100 in-depth one-on-one interviews that were conducted. (See our infographic below for top-level findings from the past five years.)\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2019infographic]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last five years, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen more women rise to the top levels of companies. An increasing number of companies are seeing the value of having more women in leadership, and they\u0026rsquo;re proving that they can make progress on gender diversity. This is an important step in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, women continue to be underrepresented at every level. To change the numbers, companies need to focus where the real problem is. We often talk about the \u0026ldquo;glass ceiling\u0026rdquo; that prevents women from reaching senior leadership positions. In reality, the biggest obstacle that women face is much earlier in the pipeline, at the first step up to manager. Fixing this \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; is the key to achieving parity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe culture of work is equally important. All employees should feel respected and that they have an equal opportunity to grow and advance. Employees care deeply about opportunity and fairness, not only for themselves but for everyone. They want the system to be fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDone right, efforts to hire and promote more diverse candidates and create a strong culture reinforce each other. A more diverse workforce will naturally lead to a more inclusive culture. And when a company\u0026rsquo;s culture feels fair and inclusive, women and underrepresented groups are happier and more likely to thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy fostering diversity, building a culture of opportunity and fairness, and focusing their attention on the broken rung, companies can close their gender gaps\u0026mdash;and make progress on the road to equality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we share highlights from the full \u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2019\u003c/em\u003e report, diving deep on the parts across pipeline and employee experience that will be most critical for companies to drive change in the next five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDespite progress at senior levels, gender parity remains out of reach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past five years, we have seen signs of progress in the representation of women in corporate America. Since 2015, the number of women in senior leadership has grown. This is particularly true in the C-suite, where the representation of women has increased from 17 percent to 21 percent (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this is a step in the right direction, parity remains out of reach. Women\u0026mdash;and particularly women of color\u0026mdash;are underrepresented at every level.[[footnote 15]] And without fundamental changes early in the pipeline, gains in women\u0026rsquo;s representation will ultimately stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20191]]\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies are adding more women to the C-suite\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, 44 percent of companies have three or more women in their C-suite, up from 29 percent of companies in 2015 (Exhibit 2). Adding even one woman can make a material difference given the critical role top executives play in shaping the business and culture of their company. Still, the overall representation of women in the C-suite is far from parity. About 1 in 5 C-suite executives is a woman\u0026mdash;and only 1 in 25 C-suite executives is a woman of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20192]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThere are signs the glass ceiling is cracking . . .\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore women are becoming senior leaders. This is driven by two trends. First, more women are being hired at the director level and higher than in the past years. Second, senior-level women are being promoted on average at a higher rate than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, men at the SVP and C-levels are slightly more likely to leave their companies, creating more open positions for women to fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e. . . But a \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; prevents women from reaching the top\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgress at the top is constrained by a \u0026ldquo;broken rung.\u0026rdquo; The biggest obstacle women face on the path to senior leadership is at the first step up to manager (Exhibit 3). For every 100 men promoted and hired to manager, only 72 women are promoted and hired. This broken rung results in more women getting stuck at the entry level, and fewer women becoming managers. Not surprisingly, men end up holding 62 percent of manager-level positions, while women hold just 38 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis early inequality has a long-term impact on the talent pipeline. Since men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, there are significantly fewer women to hire or promote to senior managers. The number of women decreases at every subsequent level. So even as hiring and promotion rates improve for women at senior levels, women as a whole can never catch up. There are simply too few women to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case for fixing the broken rung is powerful. If women are promoted and hired to first-level manager at the same rates as men, we will add one million more women to management in corporate America over the next five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20193]]\n\u003ch3\u003eTo get to gender parity, companies must fix the broken rung\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many companies, diversity efforts in hiring and promotions are focused at senior levels, and we\u0026rsquo;re encouraged by the gains that we are seeing in senior leadership. Now companies need to apply the same rigor to addressing the broken rung. Fixing it will set off a positive chain reaction across the entire pipeline. As more women become managers, there will be more women to promote and hire at each subsequent level. Put another way, more entry-level women will rise to management, and more women in management will rise to senior leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFive steps companies can take to fix their broken rung\u0026mdash;and ultimately their pipeline\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1. Set  a goal for getting more women into first-level management\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a third of companies set targets for the representation of women at first-level management, compared to 41 percent for senior levels of management. Companies should use targets more aggressively. Given how important it is to fix the broken rung, companies would be well served by setting and publicizing a bold goal to grow the number of women at the manager level. Moreover, companies should put targets in place for hiring and promotions, the processes that most directly shape employee representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. Require diverse slates for hiring and promotions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies are more likely to require diverse candidate slates for promotions at senior levels than at the manager level. But outside research shows that diverse slates can be a powerful driver of change at every level. When two or more women are included on a slate, the likelihood that a woman will get the position rises dramatically.[[footnote 16]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. Put evaluators through unconscious bias training\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconscious bias can play a large role in determining who is hired, promoted, or left behind. Companies are less likely to provide unconscious bias training for employees who participate in entry-level performance reviews than senior-level reviews, but mitigating bias at this stage is particularly important. Candidates tend to have shorter track records early in their careers, and evaluators may make unfair, gendered assumptions about their future potential. There is also compelling evidence that this training works: In companies with smaller gender disparities in representation,[[footnote 17]] half of employees received unconscious bias training in the past year, compared to only a quarter of employees in companies that aren\u0026rsquo;t making progress closing these gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e4. Establish clear evaluation criteria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to make sure they have the right processes in place to prevent bias from creeping into hiring and reviews. This means establishing clear evaluation criteria before the review process begins. Evaluation tools should also be easy to use and designed to gather objective, measurable input. For example, a rating scale is generally more effective than an open-ended assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with the right systems in place, processes can break down in practice. Employees are less likely than HR leaders to say that evaluation criteria are defined before candidate reviews begin, and they report that participating employees do not typically flag bias when they see it. This points to the need for companies to put additional safeguards in place to encourage fair, unbiased evaluations. Without exception, candidates for the same role should be evaluated using the same criteria. Employees should feel empowered to surface bias in the moment and have the training and resources to act when they observe it. In addition, outside research shows that it can help to have a third party in the room when evaluators discuss candidates to highlight potential bias and encourage objectivity.[[footnote 18]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e5. Put more women in line for the step up to manager\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is critical that women get the experience they need to be ready for management roles, as well as opportunities to raise their profile so they get tapped for them. The building blocks to make this happen are not new\u0026mdash;leadership training, sponsorship, high-profile assignments\u0026mdash;but many companies need to provide them with a renewed sense of urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTogether, opportunity and fairness are the biggest predictors of employee satisfaction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployees universally value opportunity and fairness. Across demographic groups, when employees feel they have equal opportunity for advancement and think the system is fair, they are happier with their career, plan to stay at their company longer, and are more likely to recommend it as a great place to work. In fact, we looked at a number of factors that prior outside research has shown influence employee satisfaction and retention\u0026mdash;including leadership accountability and manager support\u0026mdash;and together opportunity and fairness stand out as the strongest predictors by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMany employees think they have equal opportunity to advance\u0026mdash;but they are less convinced all employees do\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA majority of employees believe they personally have equal opportunity to grow and advance, but they are less convinced the system is fair for everyone. Fewer than half of women and men think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and fewer than a quarter say that only the most qualified candidates are promoted to manager. On both fronts, women are less optimistic than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA few key practices shape how employees view opportunity and fairness\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManager support, sponsorship, and impartial hiring and promotion practices are key elements in creating a workplace that delivers opportunity and fairness to everyone. Managers and sponsors open doors that help employees advance. And when hiring and promotions are unbiased, the most deserving employees can rise to the top\u0026mdash;and employees feel more confident that the process for advancement is fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1. Manager support\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers have a big impact on how employees view their day-to-day opportunities. Employees are more likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and advancement when their manager helps them manage their career, showcases their work, and advocates for new opportunities for them on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost managers provide this type of career support, and women and men report receiving similar amounts of help from their manager. However, managers don\u0026rsquo;t do these things with enough consistency: only about one in four employees say managers help them manage their career and about one in three say managers advocate for new opportunities for them a great deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can help by making sure managers have the tools and training they need to more fully support their team members\u0026mdash;and by rewarding them when they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. Sponsorship\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSponsorship can open doors, and more employees need it. Fewer than half of the employees at the manager level or higher serve as sponsors, and only one in three employees say they have a sponsor\u0026mdash;and this is equally true for women and men. Moreover, less than a third of employees say they get the sponsorship needed to advance their career. Fortunately, sponsorship is trending in the right direction\u0026mdash;just a year ago, a quarter of employees reported having a sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies would be wise to double down on sponsorship. Outside research shows that sponsorship accelerates career advancement,[[footnote 19]] and employees with sponsors are far more likely to say they have opportunities to grow and advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. Inclusive and unbiased hiring and promotions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen companies have strong hiring and performance review processes in place, employees are more likely to think the system is fair and the most deserving employees are able to rise to the top. Over the past five years, more companies have adopted these best practices, but progress toward full adoption is slow. This year only 6 of 323[[footnote 20]] companies report they do all of the following: set diversity targets, require diverse slates for hiring and promotions, establish clear and consistent evaluation criteria before review processes begin, and require unconscious bias training for employees involved in hiring and performance reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn combination, these are the building blocks needed to foster diversity and minimize bias in decision-making. Given that hiring and promotions are powerful levers in driving pipeline diversity and employee satisfaction, there\u0026rsquo;s a strong business case for adopting more of these best practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSome groups of women receive less support and see less opportunity to advance \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no one story of women in the workplace. Gender is one of many aspects of women\u0026rsquo;s identity that shapes their experiences. Women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, and women with disabilities are having distinct\u0026mdash;and by and large worse\u0026mdash;experiences than women overall. [[footnote 21]] Most notably, Black women and women with disabilities face more barriers to advancement, get less support from managers, and receive less sponsorship than other groups of women. Not surprisingly, Black women and women with disabilities are far less likely to feel they have an equal opportunity to grow and advance and are far less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees. They are also less happy at work and more likely to leave their company than other women are. It\u0026rsquo;s important for companies to understand that all women are not having the same experience and to directly address the unique challenges that different groups of women face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCommitment to gender diversity has increased significantly \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, 87 percent of companies are highly committed to gender diversity, compared to 56 percent in 2012, when McKinsey \u0026amp; Company first conducted a similar study on the state of women at work. Since 2015, senior leader and manager commitment to gender diversity has also increased, and employee commitment\u0026mdash;especially among men\u0026mdash;has risen significantly (Exhibit 4).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20194]]\n\u003cp\u003eIt is encouraging that so many companies prioritize gender diversity. However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that employees are less convinced: only half of employees think gender diversity is a high priority to their company, and that number hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed over the last five years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat employees think matters. When employees say their company is highly committed to gender diversity, they are happier and plan to stay at their company longer. This is equally true for women and men.[[footnote 22]] There are also signs that commitment will continue to trend in a positive direction. Younger generations are more likely to see bias in the workplace\u0026mdash;for example, managers under 30 are more likely to say they see bias than older employees at the same level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTurning commitment into action\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies need to do more to put their commitment into practice and treat gender diversity like the business priority it is. This starts with taking concrete actions like setting diversity targets and sharing diversity metrics\u0026mdash;not just at senior levels, but with all employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also means holding leaders accountable and rewarding them when they make progress. In most organizations, what gets measured and rewarded is what gets done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, more companies are putting the right mechanisms in place, and employees are noticing this progress. Compared to last year, employees are almost twice as likely to say their companies have gender diversity targets in place for hiring. However, there is more to be done. When companies have the right foundation for change\u0026mdash;clear goals, obvious accountability, a reward system\u0026mdash;they are in a better position to drive systemic change. Gender diversity efforts shift from a nice-to-have to a must-have, and that leads to broad-based action across the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe right policies can have a big impact: Engaging senior leaders is driving change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than half of companies hold senior leaders accountable for progress on gender diversity metrics, up from a little over a third in 2015. And it\u0026rsquo;s making a difference. Seventy-three percent of senior leaders are highly committed to gender diversity, and close to half say they\u0026rsquo;re working to improve gender diversity. Senior leaders set the priorities in organizations, so when they\u0026rsquo;re engaged, it has a positive trickle-down effect: Managers are more likely to support diversity efforts, and employees are more likely to think the workplace is fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a next step, companies should push deeper into their organization and engage managers to play a more active role. Compared to senior leaders, fewer managers say gender diversity is a high priority, and far fewer managers say they are actively working to improve diversity and inclusion (Exhibit 20195).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20195]]\n\u003ch4\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJess Huang\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eIrina Starikova\u003c/strong\u003e are partners in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Silicon Valley office, where \u003cstrong\u003eDelia Zanoschi\u003c/strong\u003e is a consultant; \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/alexis-krivkovich\"\u003eAlexis Krivkovich\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/lareina-yee\"\u003eLareina Yee\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e are senior partners in the San Francisco office. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[SectionHeader 2018]]\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"/our-people/alexis-krivkovich\"\u003eAlexis Krivkovich\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/marie-claude-nadeau\"\u003eMarie-Claude Nadeau\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/kelsey-robinson\"\u003eKelsey Robinson\u003c/a\u003e, Nicole Robinson, Irina Starikova, and \u003ca href=\"/our-people/lareina-yee\"\u003eLareina Yee\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProgress on gender diversity at work has stalled.

But that commitment has not translated into meaningful progress. The proportion of women at every level in corporate America has hardly changed. Progress isn\u0026rsquo;t just slow. It\u0026rsquo;s stalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s what we found in \u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2018\u003c/em\u003e, a study conducted by McKinsey in partnership with LeanIn.Org. In the fourth year of our ongoing research, we probe the issues, drawing on data from 279 companies employing more than 13 million people, as well as on a survey of over 64,000 employees and a series of qualitative interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen are doing their part. For more than 30 years, they\u0026rsquo;ve been earning more bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees than men. They\u0026rsquo;re asking for promotions and negotiating salaries at the same rates as men. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they are staying in the workforce at the same rate as men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow companies need to take more decisive action. This starts with \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity\"\u003etreating gender diversity like the business priority it is\u003c/a\u003e, from setting targets to holding leaders accountable for results. It requires closing gender gaps in hiring and promotions, especially early in the pipeline when women are most often overlooked. And it means taking bolder steps to create a respectful and inclusive culture so women\u0026mdash;and all employees\u0026mdash;feel safe and supported at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article presents highlights from the full report and presents six actions that could spark progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRevisiting the pipeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on four years of data from 462 companies employing more than 19.6 million people, including the 279 companies participating in this year\u0026rsquo;s study, two things are clear: one, women remain underrepresented, particularly women of color. Two, companies need to change the way they hire and promote entry and manager-level employees to make real progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWomen remain underrepresented\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2015, \u003ca href=\"#2015\"\u003ethe first year of this study\u003c/a\u003e, corporate America has made almost no progress improving women\u0026rsquo;s representation. Women are underrepresented at every level, and women of color are the most underrepresented group of all, lagging behind white men, men of color, and white women (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20181]]\n\u003cp\u003eFor the fourth year in a row, attrition does not explain the underrepresentation of women. Women and men are leaving their companies at similar rates, and they have similar intentions to remain in the workforce. Over half of all employees plan to stay at their companies for five or more years, and among those who intend to leave, 81 percent say they will continue to work. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that remarkably few women and men say they plan to leave the workforce to focus on family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHiring and promotion will be crucial to progress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two biggest drivers of representation are hiring and promotions, and companies are disadvantaging women in these areas from the beginning. Although women earn more bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees than men, and have for decades, they are less likely to be hired into entry-level jobs. At the first critical step up to manager, the disparity widens further. Women are less likely to be hired into manager-level jobs, and they are far less likely to be promoted into them\u0026mdash;for every 100 men promoted to manager, 79 women are (Exhibit 2). Largely because of these gender gaps, men end up holding 62 percent of manager positions, while women hold only 38 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20182]]\n\u003cp\u003eThis early inequality has a profound impact on the talent pipeline. Starting at the manager level, there are significantly fewer women to promote from within and significantly fewer women at the right experience level to hire in from the outside. So even though hiring and promotion rates improve at more senior levels, women can never catch up\u0026mdash;we\u0026rsquo;re suffering from a \u0026ldquo;hollow middle.\u0026rdquo; This should serve as a wake-up call: until companies close the early gaps in hiring and promotion, women will remain underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf companies continue to hire and promote women to manager at current rates, the number of women in management will increase by just one percentage point over the next ten years. But are companies start hiring and promoting women and men to manager at equal rates, we should get close to parity in management\u0026mdash;48 percent women versus 52 percent men\u0026mdash;over the same ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConsidering an uneven playing field\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany factors contribute to a lack of gender diversity in the workplace. This year, our report took a closer look at some of them. Beyond issues such as managerial support and access to senior leaders, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to look at a few areas that play a role\u0026mdash;including everyday discrimination, sexual harassment, and the experience of being the only woman in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEveryday discrimination\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryday sexism and racism, also known as microaggressions, can take many forms. Some can be subtle, like when someone mistakenly assumes a coworker is more junior than they really are. Some are more explicit, like when someone says something demeaning to a coworker. Whether intentional or unintentional, microaggressions signal disrespect. They also reflect inequality\u0026mdash;while anyone can be on the receiving end of disrespectful behavior, microaggressions are directed at people with less power, such as women, people of color, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor almost two-thirds of women, microaggressions are a workplace reality (Exhibit 3). Most commonly, women have to provide more evidence of their competence than men and have their judgment questioned in their area of expertise. They are also twice as likely as men to have been mistaken for someone in a more junior position. Black women, in particular, deal with a greater variety of microaggressions and are more likely than other women to have their judgment questioned in their area of expertise and be asked to provide additional evidence of their competence.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20183]]\n\u003cp\u003eLesbian women experience further slights: 71 percent have dealt with microaggressions. The nature of these encounters is often different for them: lesbian women are far more likely than other women to hear demeaning remarks in the workplace about themselves or others like them. They are also far more likely to feel like they cannot talk about their personal lives at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese negative experiences add up. As their name suggests, microaggressions can seem small when dealt with one by one. But when repeated over time, they can have a major impact: women who experience microaggressions view their workplaces as less fair and are three times more likely to regularly think about leaving their jobs than women who don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSexual harassment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSexual harassment continues to pervade the workplace. Thirty-five percent of women in corporate America experience sexual harassment at some point in their careers, from hearing sexist jokes to being touched in a sexual way.[[footnote 23]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some women the experience is far more common. Fifty-five percent of women in senior leadership, 48 percent of lesbian women, and 45 percent of women in technical fields report they\u0026rsquo;ve been sexually harassed. A common thread connects these groups: research has found that women who do not conform to traditional feminine expectations\u0026mdash;in this case, by holding authority, not being heterosexual, and working in fields dominated by men\u0026mdash;are more often the targets of sexual harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety-eight percent of companies have policies that make it clear sexual harassment is not tolerated, but many employees think their companies are falling short putting policies into practice. Only 62 percent of employees say that in the past year their companies have reaffirmed sexual harassment won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated, and a similar number say that they\u0026rsquo;ve received training or guidance on the topic. Moreover, only 60 percent of employees think a sexual-harassment claim would be fairly investigated and addressed by their company\u0026mdash;and just one in three believe it would be addressed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also stark differences in how women and men view their company\u0026rsquo;s efforts to create a safe and respectful work environment. Only 32 percent of women think that disrespectful behavior toward women is often quickly addressed by their companies, compared with 50 percent of men. Women are far less confident that reporting sexual harassment will lead to a fair investigation. And they are twice as likely as men to say that it would be risky or pointless to report an incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese numbers indicate the urgent need for companies to underscore that bad behavior is unacceptable and will not go overlooked. Leaders at all levels should set the tone by publicly stating sexual harassment won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated and by modeling inclusive behavior. HR teams should receive detailed training so they know how to thoroughly and compassionately investigate claims of harassment, even if they involve senior leaders. And companies would benefit from putting an audit process in place to ensure that investigations are thorough and sanctions are appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe \u0026lsquo;Only\u0026rsquo; experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing \u0026ldquo;the only one\u0026rdquo; is still a common experience for women. One in five women say they are often the only woman or one of the only women in the room at work: in other words, they are \u0026ldquo;Onlys.\u0026rdquo;  This is twice as common for senior-level women and women in technical roles: around 40 percent are Onlys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who are Onlys are having a significantly worse experience than women who work with other women. More than 80 percent are on the receiving end of microaggressions, compared with 64 percent of women as a whole. They are more likely to have their abilities challenged, to be subjected to unprofessional and demeaning remarks, and to feel like they cannot talk about their personal lives at work (Exhibit 4). Most notably, women Onlys are almost twice as likely to have been sexually harassed at some point in their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20184]]\n\u003cp\u003eFar fewer men are Onlys\u0026mdash;just 7 percent say that they are often the only or one of the only men in the room\u0026mdash;and regardless of their race and ethnicity, they face less scrutiny than women Onlys. By and large, White men who are Onlys have a better experience than any other group of Onlys, likely because they are broadly well represented in their company and are a high-status group in society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen Onlys have a more difficult time. Because there are so few, women Onlys stand out in a crowd of men. This heightened visibility can make the biases women Onlys face especially pronounced. While they are just one person, they often become a stand-in for all women\u0026mdash;their individual successes or failures become a litmus test for what all women are capable of doing. With everyone\u0026rsquo;s eyes on them, women Onlys can be heavily scrutinized and held to higher performance standards. As a result, they most often feel pressure to perform, on guard, and left out. In contrast, when asked how it feels to be the only man in the room, men Onlys most frequently say they feel included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only also affects the way women view their workplace. Compared with other women, women Onlys are less likely to think that the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, promotions are fair and objective, and ideas are judged by their quality rather than who raised them. Not surprisingly, given the negative experiences and feelings associated with being the odd woman out, women Onlys are also 1.5 times more likely to think about leaving their job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMapping a path to gender equality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of companies say that they\u0026rsquo;re highly committed to gender and racial diversity\u0026mdash;yet the evidence indicates that many are still not treating diversity as the business imperative it is. That\u0026rsquo;s apparent in the lack of progress in the pipeline over the past four years (Exhibit 5).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20185]]\n\u003cp\u003eTake gender diversity as an example. In contrast with what companies say about their commitment, only around half of all employees think that their company sees gender diversity as a priority and is doing what it takes to make progress. Around 20 percent of employees say that their company\u0026rsquo;s commitment to gender diversity feels like lip service. And few companies are making a strong business case for gender diversity: while 76 percent of companies have articulated a business case, only 13 percent have taken the critical next step of calculating the positive impact on their business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are six actions companies need to take to make progress on gender diversity.

One of the most powerful reasons for the lack of progress is a simple one: we have blind spots when it comes to diversity, and we can\u0026rsquo;t solve problems that we don\u0026rsquo;t see or understand clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany employees think women are well represented in leadership when they see only a few. And because they\u0026rsquo;ve become comfortable with the status quo, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel any urgency for change. Further, many men don\u0026rsquo;t fully grasp the barriers that hold women back at work. As a result, they are less committed to gender diversity, and we can\u0026rsquo;t get there without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies also overlook the realities of women of color, who face the greatest obstacles and receive the least support. When companies take a one-size-fits-all approach to advancing women, women of color end up underserved and left behind.

Two themes emerge this year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInequality starts at the very first promotion. This is even more dramatic for women of color.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women remain significantly underrepresented in the corporate pipeline (Exhibit 1). From the outset, fewer women than men are hired at the entry level, despite women being 57 percent of recent college graduates. At every subsequent step, the representation of women further declines, and women of color face an even steeper drop-off at senior levels. As a result, one in five C-suite leaders is a woman, and fewer than one in 30 is a woman of color. Moreover, compared with the modest gains women made in prior years, there are signs this year that \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/whats-stalling-progress-for-women-at-work\"\u003ewomen\u0026rsquo;s progress may be stalling\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20171]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen are not leaving their companies at higher rates than men, and very few plan to leave the workforce to focus on family.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Compared with men of the same race and ethnicity, women are leaving their companies at similar rates: White women are leaving as frequently as white men, and we see the same pattern among women and men of color. However, there is a large racial gap: people of color are significantly more likely to leave their organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen and men also have similar intentions to stay in the workforce. Roughly 60 percent of all employees plan to remain at their companies for five or more years. Moreover, among those who are planning to leave, about 80 percent intend to find a job elsewhere and remain in the workforce. Notably, just as many men as women say they\u0026rsquo;ll leave to focus on family, and the number for both genders is remarkably low: 2 percent or less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChanging the workplace experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the results of a survey of more than 70,000 employees from 82 of this year\u0026rsquo;s participating companies, three trends that disadvantage women are clear:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen experience a workplace skewed in favor of men.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e On average, women are promoted at a lower rate than men. The biggest gender gap is at the first step up to manager: entry-level women are 18 percent less likely to be promoted than their male peers. This gender disparity has a dramatic effect on the pipeline as a whole. If entry-level women were promoted at the same rate as their male peers, the number of women at the senior vice president and C-suite levels would more than double. And the disparity in promotions is not for lack of desire to advance. Women are just as interested in being promoted as men, and they ask for promotions at comparable rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps unsurprisingly, women are less optimistic about their prospects.

For instance, although women in general are more likely than men to report they never interact with senior leaders, Black women are the most likely of all to report they never have senior-level contact. This may affect how they view the workplace and their opportunities for advancement. Perhaps because of the challenges they face in the workplace, for example, Black women are also the most interested in going out on their own. Compared with other groups of women, they\u0026rsquo;re significantly more likely to say they intend to start a business when they leave their current job. And yet: despite facing more pitfalls to advancement, women of color have higher ambitions to be a top executive than White women.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20172]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen and men see the state of women\u0026mdash;and the success of gender-diversity efforts\u0026mdash;differently.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Men are more likely to think the workplace is equitable; women see a workplace that is less fair and offers less support (Exhibit 3).

In this article, we describe three enablers that have helped companies repair the broken rung on the career ladder for women in technical roles: providing equitable access to skill building, implementing a structured process that seeks to debias promotions, and building a strong culture of support for women via mentors (who can provide encouragement and empathy, as well as help women work toward goals and address challenges or obstacles) and sponsors (who can create opportunities and actively advocate for the advancement of those they sponsor).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy the broken rung matters\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eEarly promotions in a career are most critical to success,[[Footnote 3]] and yet for the past eight years, McKinsey research has consistently shown that women lose ground in the step up to manager.

This affects women\u0026rsquo;s lives and livelihoods and could create negative financial and cultural consequences for companies, since companies where \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003ewomen are well represented at the top earn up to 50 percent higher profits and share performance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the leaders we interviewed acknowledged that their companies have uneven early-promotions processes that perpetuate the broken rung on the career ladder for women in technical roles. But few said that their companies had begun to monitor the advancement of women in these roles during the first five years after they are hired. And while many interviewees said that their companies offer mentorship programs, conscious inclusion training, and other diversity and inclusion programs, only a small number could name interventions aimed at achieving gender parity in promotions for early-tenure women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;There is something unique about retaining a woman \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; player.

For this to happen, groundwork needs to be laid ahead of time via access to timely opportunities that help colleagues demonstrate their growth and maturity and readiness to advance. Our interviews suggest that companies can better support the advancement of women in technical roles by providing them with opportunities to build a wide array of skills, along with structured guidance on their professional development. Leading companies can expand formal skills development beyond technical training, offering resources such as sessions on how to prioritize career development and how to be effective in promotion interviews; matching programs that pair women with sponsors (who can offer seniority, power, and influence to help those they are sponsoring meet their goals); networking groups; and a formalized professional-development process. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[PullQuote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also important for women in technical roles to join high-visibility projects where they can develop their skills on the job. One interviewee, from a tech firm, explained that their company had created a skills-based promotion process for early-tenure employees. The process specified indicators of success for milestones linked to promotion decisions. However, the company hadn\u0026rsquo;t created an easy way for employees to find projects where they could develop the skills expected at higher ranks. Feeling deprived of these valuable opportunities, women told us they perceived promotions as unattainable, and many chose to leave. To correct this, some companies have created project databases where tech employees can search for opportunities according to the type of skills required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Early promotions can be heavily influenced by perception. If you have one good project, high visibility or proximity to the right leaders, you become part of the inner circle and get promoted faster. We are geographically diverse, but it may be that people in the headquarters interact more with senior leadership and get the best projects. We are implementing an early-career program that tries to curtail the \u0026lsquo;inner circle\u0026rsquo; problem by enabling women to have more meet and greets, rotational opportunities, and formal mentorship.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female HR leader, healthcare\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Implement a structured approach to early promotions \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur interviews suggest that many organizations could do much more to standardize their promotion processes for early-tenure technical roles and eliminate unintentional bias. Only two of the 40\u0026nbsp;leaders we spoke with said that their organizations do not have a broken-rung problem. Both work for large, Fortune 100 technology companies that have invested heavily in highly structured, clear, and transparent systems, with well-defined skills criteria for each role and level (Exhibit 2). Both companies have developed extensive manager training programs, built accountability into their processes, and set clear bars for when the first two promotions should be expected. Employees at these companies check in with managers frequently to ensure that they have access to projects that will help them gain the skills they need to advance, and when employees don\u0026rsquo;t advance in the projected timelines, senior leaders follow up to understand the impediments. Early-tenure promotions are decided by committee rather than by individuals, and bias checks are integrated into the process. Because these companies set expectations in which everyone must advance within a specified time, they are effectively aiming for 100 percent participation in early-tenure promotions. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;My company had a timeline for when you should be asking questions of your mentor [about being promoted]. The structure was incredible for me because it gave me the opportunity to have the right conversations and a perspective on where I should be in the process. It was like running a marathon and having someone tell you where the water stations are.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female supervisor, industrial \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who work at organizations that lack a clear, equitable promotion structure for early-tenure employees say they face an upward pathway that can be ambiguous, uneven, and biased. For example, one interviewee mentioned a company rule that employees must work full-time for seven months or more within a calendar year before being considered for promotion. This requirement omits many women who take maternity leave. Other interviewees said that their companies\u0026rsquo; promotion processes tend to favor people with close proximity to leaders, which can impede the advancement of employees who work remotely or in satellite offices. Obstacles such as these make it difficult for women in technical roles to earn promotions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;The word I\u0026rsquo;d use to describe promotions is \u0026lsquo;struggle.\u0026rsquo; I personally have seen people that look like me continue to be overlooked for promotions. We have to work two to five times harder to get a promotion. In my seven years here, I\u0026rsquo;ve been promoted multiple times. It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears on my end and me raising a concern as to why there aren\u0026rsquo;t more people that look like me represented in the leadership team.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female supervisor, media\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Connect early-tenure women with capable managers, mentors, and sponsors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing that senior colleagues play a valuable role in the professional development of workers who are early in their careers, leading companies take measures to help women in technical roles connect with people who have more experience. Direct managers often play an especially important role in the professional lives of early-tenure employees. They have the most direct view of the employee\u0026rsquo;s responsibilities and performance, and they serve as the coach, advocate, and decision maker for the employee\u0026rsquo;s promotion. However, many managers of junior tech employees have little management training or experience themselves. Even with good intentions, they can create uneven experiences for early-tenure workers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading companies counter these shortcomings by investing in the development of managers at lower levels. A new manager at a tech company, who had just received her second promotion, told us about the stress of having to promote people for the first time. However, her company provided extensive training and documentation to help her make a strong case for the advancement of her team\u0026rsquo;s members. Her own supervisor also stepped in, setting up quarterly meetings to discuss the potential promotions for her team. All these actions gave the new manager the tools that helped her to act as a sponsor for her own team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;When I went for my first chief architect role, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get it. Then the head of enterprise architecture called me and said, \u0026lsquo;You were number two. Let me tell you what you need to work on.\u0026rsquo; He gave me actionable feedback. If he had not called, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I would\u0026rsquo;ve gone for it again. Who knows how that would\u0026rsquo;ve affected my path? He gave me something actionable, and that is a gift I now give to everyone I meet. One year later, I got promoted because I worked on what he said, and I was prepared for the next opportunity.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female chief engineer, banking\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentors and sponsors can help women in technical roles develop leadership and management skills, improve their interviewing abilities, and focus on the skills needed to advance. Indeed, at companies that lack clear promotion structures or well-trained managers, mentors and sponsors play an outsize part in educating and coaching women on a company\u0026rsquo;s unwritten expectations, and in advocating for their advancement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chief information officer at a large bank told us about her experience receiving support from sponsors. When she first became eligible for promotion, she believed that she could apply only if all her skills matched the stated job requirements. But her sponsors counseled her that the leaders in charge of promotions considered some skills essential but saw others as skills that candidates could develop on the job. One particular leader advised her on which specific skills to develop and showcase. Acting on that feedback, she felt well prepared for the promotion interview and advanced quickly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is ample opportunity for companies to focus on the early-career development of women in technical roles and to deepen a talent pool that is integral to their success. Our research shows what leading companies have done to make career development easier\u0026mdash;and fairer\u0026mdash;for women in technical roles. The combination of career-development opportunities, structured promotion processes, and support from senior colleagues has proven effective at advancing and retaining women in technical roles and can, in time, help diversify leadership teams. While these interventions may feel applicable to women in any role, the impact on technology functions by applying them can be significant\u0026mdash;particularly because only a few companies are focusing on the broken rung in those fields today. And these improvements are not only good for business performance: they can also help women in technical roles realize significant professional benefits of their own.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Authors":[],"UseEnhancedAuthors":{"value":false},"Acknowledgements":{"value":""},"About The Authors":{"value":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSian Griffiths\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Washington, DC, office, \u003cstrong\u003ePetra Kubalcikova\u003c/strong\u003e is a user research lead in the Prague office, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/gayatri-shenai\"\u003eGayatri Shenai\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in the New York office, and \u003cstrong\u003eCathy Wright\u003c/strong\u003e is a technology and digital change director in the Bay Area office. \u003cstrong\u003eAdriana Gascoigne\u003c/strong\u003e is the founder and CEO of Girls in Tech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe authors wish to thank their sponsors and advisers from Girls in Tech, including Sastry Durvasula, as well as Kweilin Ellingrud, Nora Gardner, Olga Kulak, Shalonna Melton, Siddharth Muchhal, D.

While the spate of tech layoffs in the face of economic uncertainties ahead has caused companies to rethink their talent strategies, only 7 percent of the layoffs have been in Europe, according to the \u003cem\u003eState of European tech\u003c/em\u003e report for 2022,[[footnote 3]] and the underlying economic fundamentals that rely on tech talent remain in place. In fact, McKinsey analysis shows a tech talent gap of 1.4 million to 3.9 million people by 2027 for EU-27 countries.[[footnote 4]] If Europe could double the share of women in the tech workforce to about 45 percent, or an estimated 3.9 million additional women by 2027\u0026mdash;something we believe is possible\u0026mdash;it could close this talent gap and benefit from a GDP increase of as much as \u0026euro;260 billion to \u0026euro;600 billion.[[footnote 5]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[sidebar 1]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo better understand why Europe struggles to find and retain tech-talented women, and to determine how best to address the issue, we undertook a detailed analysis of the entire development funnel in Europe, from primary school all the way to entering the workforce (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;About the research\u0026rdquo;). The analysis produced some interesting insights:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA significant drop in the percentage of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) classes happens at two points: during the transition from primary and secondary education to university, when it drops 18 percentage points, and during the transition from university to the workforce, when it drops another 15 (Exhibit 1).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile the rate of women working within tech \u003cem\u003ecompanies\u003c/em\u003e (such as social networks) is closer to parity, the rate of women working within tech \u003cem\u003eroles\u003c/em\u003e (such as developers and data engineers) is much lower.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe problem is likely to get worse. Women\u0026rsquo;s graduation rate in STEM disciplines during higher education is declining.[[footnote 6]] Furthermore, the share of women in the workforce is lowest in the tech roles that are growing fastest, such as DevOps and cloud. At current rates, the share of women in tech roles in Europe is heading toward a decline to 21 percent by 2027.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 1]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a tough problem to solve. However, although there are no silver bullets, four interventions\u0026mdash;redressing bias in the workforce, improving retention rates, reskilling women into tech roles, and bolstering girls in STEM classes earlier in their educational process\u0026mdash;can have a significant impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA closer look: First drop-off\u0026mdash;from primary and secondary education to university\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring primary and secondary education, there are no indications that girls lag behind boys in STEM classes. In fact, in Bulgaria, Finland, Latvia, and Sweden, girls slightly outperform boys in science and math tests.[[footnote 7]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this fact, there\u0026rsquo;s an 18-percentage-point drop in girls going into STEM disciplines when they go to university. The drop is even more dramatic\u0026mdash;31 percentage points\u0026mdash;when analyzing young women going into ICT disciplines (ICT is a subsegment of STEM that focuses on information science, computer science, and technology, fields that more closely match education requirements for those going into tech roles) (Exhibit 2). Worse, trend lines showed a small but steady decline of one to two percentage points in women STEM graduates from 2016\u0026ndash;20. This is all the more discouraging because in some STEM disciplines, such as natural science, we are almost reaching gender parity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two main reasons for these drop-offs. The first is that secondary-school girls get significantly less teacher, parental, and peer support than boys do for pursuing STEM careers.[[footnote 8]] Second, some research suggests that girls are told that they aren\u0026rsquo;t good at STEM, often communicated in subtle but debilitating behaviors, such as teachers in STEM classes calling on boys more than girls.[[footnote 9]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis drop-off has the potential to create a self-fulfilling downward cycle. With only 19 percent of ICT bachelor students being women, the resulting isolation is often another reason women drop out of these classes.[[footnote 10]] The silver lining in the data is that women\u0026rsquo;s graduation rates are on par with or slightly higher than men\u0026rsquo;s, suggesting that women who choose these disciplines are more likely than men to stick with them over the course of their higher education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[disruptor1up learnmore]]\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA closer look: Second drop-off\u0026mdash;from university to the workforce\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAcross multiple industries, the data shows another dispiriting and significant drop-off in the percentage of women who transition into tech roles after graduation. Only 23 percent of women STEM majors end up in tech roles, compared with 44 percent of men.[[footnote 11]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe distribution of women in specific tech roles across all companies also varies significantly (Exhibit 3). Their greatest participation rate as a percentage of available roles is in product design and management (46 percent) and in data engineering, science, and analytics (30 percent). Their lowest participation rates are in DevOps and cloud roles (8 percent) and compute and operations roles (15 percent).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 3]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data is only slightly more promising when we consider women who work at tech companies. While 37 percent of people who work in European tech and tech-adjacent companies are women, with the highest share being in social networking companies (50 percent) and e-commerce businesses (46 percent), the broader pattern remains the same, with women as just 25 percent of those working in tech roles (Exhibit 4).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 4]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the current representation of women in tech is particularly concerning because the very roles where women have the lowest share are exactly those that will have the highest demand and impact in coming years. For example, while 19 percent of people in the software engineering and architecture functions overall are women, they are only 10 percent of the cloud solution architects and 13 percent of the Python developers, two roles with the highest demand in the job market, according to Eightfold AI analysis (Exhibit 5). Even as a new generation of advanced technologies\u0026mdash;from low-code/no-code solutions to generative AI\u0026mdash;becomes more common, we anticipate there will continue to be an important need for skilled engineers and developers to not just enhance and maintain those technologies but also develop the next \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech\"\u003egeneration of technologies\u003c/a\u003e (for example, quantum, Web3, and trust architectures).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 5]]\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe way forward: Four interventions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRedressing this imbalance is not easy, and no single solution has emerged. But four intervention strategies could have a big effect (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 6]]\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReframe: Enable women in tech to thrive at work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased upon our analysis, companies can increase the number of women in tech roles by 480,000 to one million by ensuring companies, and men in positions of influence, provide women with support so they can thrive today in today\u0026rsquo;s digital workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies should start with a comprehensive plan that actively addresses the pain points and needs of women. Some 70 percent of women in tech, in fact, still feel like they need to work harder and prove themselves because of their gender.[[footnote 12]] Reducing \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number\"\u003eisolation of women in tech\u003c/a\u003e roles by ensuring multiple women are working in the same location can help, as does instituting broader support networks, supportive HR policies, and effective sponsorship.[[footnote 13]] Active sponsorship\u0026mdash;often from men\u0026mdash;in the form of advocating for women and opening doors to sponsors\u0026rsquo; networks, in fact, increases the chances that women\u0026rsquo;s ideas are heard (by 70 percent) and are likely to be implemented (by 200 percent).[[footnote 14]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eImproving flexibility at work can have a profound effect on addressing women\u0026rsquo;s needs as well. Around 7 percent of European women (versus 0.5 percent of men) are out of the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities at home, and almost one in four women cite lack of work\u0026ndash;life balance as a key reason for leaving tech careers.[[footnote 15]] Offering remote or hybrid working programs, flexible working hours, and on-site childcare, for example, can make a big difference. One European entertainment company found that offering a \u0026ldquo;work from everywhere\u0026rdquo; policy lowered its attrition rates by 15 percent and increased women leaders from 25 percent to 42 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[disruptor1up readnext]]\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRetain: Give women a reason to stay in tech\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver half of women in tech leave the industry by the midpoint of their career\u0026mdash;more than double the rate of men\u0026mdash;resulting in many fewer women reaching leadership roles.[[footnote 16]] By improving the retention of women, European businesses could increase the number of women in tech by 370,000 to 440,000, according to our analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResearch shows that women cite two primary reasons for leaving. One is that companies do not provide them with strong management support and/or good opportunities. A recent Integrating Women Leaders Foundation study underscores this issue, finding that while 77 percent of executive men believe they are active allies for gender equality in their companies, only 45 percent of women executives agree.[[footnote 17]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAddressing this issue is complex, but an important element is developing effective \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/mining-for-tech-talent-gold-seven-ways-to-find-and-keep-diverse-talent\"\u003ediversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices\u003c/a\u003e, such as strong assessment and measurement programs and accountability, and integrating them into the natural flow of business. That includes, for example, having KPIs for retaining women talent as part of the overall talent dashboard that leaders use (rather than making it a separate dashboard) and including retention goals for women as part of managers\u0026rsquo; performance reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second issue is that women who aspire to better tech roles often feel they need to change employers. This is part of a broader trend: \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/human-capital-at-work-the-value-of-experience\"\u003eMcKinsey research\u003c/a\u003e shows that more than 80 percent of role moves involve people moving from one employer to another, suggesting that changing employers is the route taken by most workers wanting to upgrade their roles.[[footnote 18]] While reasons for switching employers vary, offering flexible career pathways and proactively working with women to explore new tech paths in their career development can help organizations retain more women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRedeploy: Ensure women are in tech roles that matter\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can increase the number of women in tech roles by as much as 530,000 to 1.8 million by 2027 through a range of practices. These include \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/overcoming-the-fear-factor-in-hiring-tech-talent\"\u003ehiring women from untapped pools, training them in modern technologies (such as agile and MLOps), and building up their tech skills\u003c/a\u003e.[[footnote 19]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this hiring aspiration represents the top threshold of potential in terms of pure numbers, the greater value is more in the quality of the shift rather than in the quantity of those making it. Many women, in fact, work in the fastest-declining tech roles, such as systems administrators and programmer analysts, which are also the roles that have been disproportionately affected by the recent waves of tech layoffs.[[footnote 20]] Companies should focus on hiring and training women to assume tech roles that are gaining importance in the marketplace and society, such as product leads, machine learning engineers, and AI experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies could borrow a page from tech companies, where today about 44 percent of women in tech roles come from non-STEM educational backgrounds and learn on the job (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[[exhibit 7]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe full potential that can be unlocked by redeployment comes from three groups, totaling 270,000\u0026ndash;850,000 women. The first is STEM-educated European women who have the most in-demand tech skills, such as SQL and Python, but are working in nontech roles (39 percent of this group). The second is European women who also possess these in-demand tech skills and are working in nontech roles (3 percent of this much larger group). And the third group is made up of European women with tech skills adjacent to those that are most in demand\u0026mdash;for example, adjacent skills such as C++, Java, and Linux for top-rising skills such as Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne leading big-tech company is tapping this potential with an apprenticeship program to reskill and upskill traditionally overlooked talent pools such as single stay-at-home mothers. By combining in-class learning and hands-on engineering projects, the company has hired 98 percent of the women in its North American and African cohorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRamp up: Address STEM drop-off in university\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\n\u003cp\u003eGetting more girls to choose a STEM major is a great ambition, but it won\u0026rsquo;t help much, according to our analysis. Given current drop-off rates across bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree programs, even if countries could increase the number of girls enrolling in STEM university classes by 1 percent (around 300,000 women), that would lead to only about 15,000 more women entering tech roles until 2027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo drive significant change, programs supporting women already in university STEM classes can have the most impact. Providing more and better internship opportunities, mentoring and coaching women as they prepare to enter the workforce, and actively recruiting women to work on cutting-edge projects in leadership roles, among other programs, can help increase graduation rates for women in STEM and increase their overall numbers in tech by about 225,000\u0026ndash;695,000, according to our analysis. The earlier drop-offs across primary and secondary education must also be addressed to fix the broken STEM rung in women\u0026rsquo;s tech career ladder over the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWomen can fix European tech\u0026rsquo;s talent challenge, but only if and when companies address the issues that keep more women from joining and staying in the tech workforce can Europe hope to build its competitive edge.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Authors":[{"id":"1c9d21f3-fc67-4426-8c3a-676fe8604551","url":"","name":"Sven Blumberg","displayName":"Sven Blumberg","fields":{"Profile":[{"id":"f027c3a2-903b-41bc-9604-86b08292cc42","url":"/our-people/sven-blumberg","name":"Sven Blumberg","displayName":"Sven Blumberg","fields":{"Independent Image":{"value":{}},"Standard Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/our people/sven blumberg/sven-blumberg_00816_fc-mask_profile_1536x1152.png","alt":"Sven Blumberg","width":"1536","height":"1152","Description":""}},"Thumbnail Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/our people/sven blumberg/sven-blumberg_00816_fc-mask_headshot_988x741.png","alt":"Sven Blumberg","width":"988","height":"741","Description":""}},"Full Bleed Image":{"value":{}},"Hero Mode":"{3F236DEE-C56F-43BE-91FF-F50543B48857}","Card Background":{"value":""},"Card Background Header":{"value":""},"Additional Expertise":{"value":""},"About Name":{"value":"Sven"},"Background":{"value":"\u003ch3\u003ePublished Work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/women-in-tech-the-best-bet-to-solve-europes-talent-shortage\"\u003eWomen in tech: The best bet to solve Europe\u0026rsquo;s talent shortage\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026rdquo;

Our analysis shows \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/how-companies-can-win-in-the-seven-tech-talent-battlegrounds\"\u003ethat significant skill gaps exist in seven areas\u003c/a\u003e, and we expect them to become more severe over time (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;Tech talent: Skills in demand\u0026rdquo;). In Germany, for example, 780,000 additional tech specialists are needed by 2026 to meet the economy\u0026rsquo;s demand.[[footnote 4]] Globally, more than three million cybersecurity positions were unfilled as of 2020.[[footnote 5]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness leaders are feeling the heat.

You can\u0026rsquo;t be good at just one aspect of talent management and expect to succeed\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFulfilling your tech-talent needs is increasingly a multifaceted contest. Finding great talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t help if the talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to work for you, and hiring great talent doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the talent leaves quickly. Companies have to invest simultaneously across the entire \u0026ldquo;hire to retire\u0026rdquo; life cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat starts with developing a digital-talent engine, a focused team dedicated to managing the entire employee experience, from hiring and onboarding to creating new career paths and continuously building skills. One large agricultural company established a digital-talent engine, which focused on modernizing talent sourcing by using contract-to-hire agreements and leveraging new digital channels (such as Topcoder), including coding exercises in candidate interviews, and implementing a candidate-tracking system to manage the hiring journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key activities of this more holistic approach to talent can be broken down into three areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorkforce:\u003c/em\u003e Develop a clear and surgical understanding of your talent gaps, a practical plan to fill them, and a hiring approach centered on candidate experience.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWork model:\u003c/em\u003e Put in place a work model that enables small teams of engineers to work on the most interesting problems unfettered by layers of management.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorkplace:\u003c/em\u003e Create a work environment that nurtures talent through diversity and a supportive culture, which is especially important within the context of hybrid and remote models.

Close your talent gap; it\u0026rsquo;s wider than you think\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most effective talent strategies are grounded in a clear view of what capabilities the business needs to generate value compared with those it already has, especially in the area of \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/six-practical-actions-for-building-the-cloud-talent-you-need\"\u003ecloud talent\u003c/a\u003e.

That\u0026rsquo;s often because companies\u0026rsquo; talent analysis stops at the role level rather than probing what skills their people actually have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one digital-attacker bank did a detailed assessment of its talent, for example, it was shocked to find that only 35 percent of its senior tech talent had the skills the bank needed, and more than 50 percent of the talent required significant, systematic capability building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkforce planning also needs to happen much more frequently than the typical once or twice a year in order to keep pace with changing demands and shifts in the makeup of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Think candidate experiences, not recruiting process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo improve recruiting, HR departments and hiring managers tend to focus on improving their recruiting processes and introducing efficiencies. A more effective approach is to \u0026ldquo;think like a recruit\u0026rdquo; and focus on the candidate experience. That includes improving the virtual candidate experience, since 70 percent of companies in a recent survey said their recruiting and onboarding was at least half virtual.[[footnote 7]] Ways of doing that include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eTech talent wants to meet other technologists, so make sure that engineers and other relevant roles are part of your interview team. Bring your best people to interviews, online events, and conferences.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eGood candidates are ambitious and have many options. Develop an interview and evaluation approach that can lead to a decision in as little as one day. Before candidates even come through the door, assess their skills with tools such as HackerRank.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003ePost and pray is not a strategy. Tech talent isn\u0026rsquo;t just going to job sites, so be active in nontraditional channels, such as hackathons, open-source channels, and specific curated sites for different skills. For some companies, GitHub is their best recruiting channel.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eTop talent is eager to get going, so when new hires show up to start work, make sure there is an onboarding point of contact to help them navigate the company. The onboarding process should be streamlined so that, by the end of week one, developers are able to commit code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eAn entertainment company revamped the candidate experience by reducing the steps in the process, creating clarity on the bar for each role, and ensuring that engineers conducted the interviews. These three shifts reduced their \u0026ldquo;first-touch-to-offer\u0026rdquo; time from more than 90 days to fewer than ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Top talent is interviewing you, not the other way around\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would tech rock stars want to work for you? While money is important, top candidates care about working with newer technologies, building up their skills, being part of a culture that values technology, connecting with a purpose they find meaningful, and, most importantly, working on interesting and inspiring problems. The CIO of a leading European online marketplace, in fact, chose Scala over Java because that was tech talent\u0026rsquo;s preference at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe employee value proposition (EVP) is critical in addressing these points. One European public-sector institution was having trouble filling 400 tech roles. It refocused its EVP on its mission to work for the \u0026ldquo;greater good,\u0026rdquo; such as establishing digital services for all citizens, improving the citizen experience, and making services provided by the administration faster and more reliable. It was able to significantly increase the number of applications received and thus shorten the process to fill positions to a matter of weeks rather than the many months it used to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe EVP needs to be backed up \u0026ldquo;on the ground\u0026rdquo; with programs and a culture that explicitly deliver on the promise. If talent sees that there is a disconnect between the stated EVP and the reality on the ground, they\u0026rsquo;re quick to leave and, worse, tell others. That can be devastating, because the most common way job seekers learn about companies is by reading company reviews from third-party sites, such as Glassdoor or Blind.[[footnote 8]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e5. You can\u0026rsquo;t hire or outsource your way out of your talent problems\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with relying on hiring is that often there is a significant lag time before someone becomes productive as well as there being a general shortfall of qualified talent. Similarly, \u003ca href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-reset-the-it-talent-model/\"\u003ecore capabilities need to remain in house to enable the business to move quickly\u003c/a\u003e, so outsourcing can\u0026rsquo;t be the main answer either. The reality is that much of the talent you need will have to come from within the organization. Your workforce planning should identify the appropriate balance between building skills internally, hiring externally, and outsourcing (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eTo build up skills internally, top companies move past traditional and subscale programs to make training both continuous (through ongoing learning journeys) and tailored (with learning programs created for specific roles and job families); see Exhibit 2 for an example of such a learning journey. They place an emphasis on building experience rather than simply providing certifications. Effective reskilling is based on a clear understanding of what existing skills will best translate into new skills. For example, project managers don\u0026rsquo;t tend to make good scrum masters, while a motivated mainframe engineer can often learn new technology stacks and languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\u003ch2\u003eWork model\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e6.

But many of these top engineers can\u0026rsquo;t work in traditional organizations where a surfeit of managers and bureaucratic processes inhibit them from doing good work at pace. In many organizations, the ratio of engineers to management and coordination and support people is 30:70; that needs to be flipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTech leaders reshape their IT organizations around \u003ca href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/its-time-to-reset-the-it-talent-model/\"\u003esmall squads\u003c/a\u003e to create highly motivated, self-managing, agile teams. Instead of managing the team day to day or simply telling them what to do, successful leaders focus on clearing organizational roadblocks, enabling team-level decision making, and setting vision and direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne group insurer struggling to modernize how it onboarded new clients, decided to build a small, autonomous team with a core of its best engineering talent. It gave the team a broad charter to reinvent the onboarding process and protected them from most of the red tape. The team designed a compelling client journey and developed a groundbreaking technology that connected to each client\u0026rsquo;s human-resource information system (HRIS). It uploaded employee information, automatically determined insurability, and onboarded employees into the new plan. This approach helped the insurer close its first multimillion-dollar sale only four months after it was launched. In addition, the team members embraced the experience and became champions of the new way of working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e7. Eliminate meaningless toil and bad practices\u0026mdash;top talent won\u0026rsquo;t put up with it\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0026rsquo;t hire virtuoso jazz pianists and have them just practice scales all day. In the same way, top tech talent needs a work environment where they can fully practice their craft. Leading organizations focus on eliminating as many barriers as possible for their top coders. They invest, for example, in developing high-quality, reusable code and provide world-class planning and development tools to make engineers\u0026rsquo; work lives easier. They strive to make more than 80 percent of testing automated and continuous\u0026mdash;with \u003ca href=\"/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/when-code-is-king-mastering-automotive-software-excellence\"\u003edevelopment done only after test cases are written\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eState-of-the-art production and preproduction environments are well integrated with development and testing environments, while best practices, such as continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and working in the cloud, are the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading companies are also investing in low-code and no-code platforms that enable the average business user to develop applications without any software experience, freeing up seasoned developers to focus on the most challenging tasks. One pharmaceutical company grew its low-code platform base from \u003ca href=\"/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance\"\u003eeight users to 1,400 in just one year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne model to consider is the \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/building-a-cloud-ready-operating-model-for-agility-and-resiliency\"\u003esite-reliability-engineering (SRE) approach\u003c/a\u003e, where specific champions are entrusted with, and accountable for, eliminating toil for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[disruptor1up readnext]]\n\u003ch2\u003eWorkplace\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e8. Focus on developer happiness, and productivity and performance will follow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetaining top talent requires an environment where developers are treated like innovators, not code writers, and are \u003ca href=\"/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/unleashing-developers-full-talents-an-interview-with-twilios-ceo\"\u003eactive participants\u003c/a\u003e in the business. McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Organizational Health Index research, however, has shown that IT functions overall score well below the average in terms of organizational \u0026ldquo;health\u0026rdquo; (the ability to align around and execute strategic goals).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness leaders can reverse this situation by making the quality of the developer experience a primary metric of success and using data to closely track job satisfaction. Microsoft, for example, turned to calendaring data (among other sources of information), which revealed that in the company\u0026rsquo;s devices unit, management practices related to meetings were reducing engineers\u0026rsquo; job satisfaction.[[footnote 9]] One of the most important metrics is how many of your developers are recruiting other developers, because it signals how strongly your people believe in your company and its vision. So make referral programs transparent and efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowth is also essential in building an engineering culture, and it can take many forms. Top engineers don\u0026rsquo;t want to just bang out features; they want to experiment with new code, become better developers, and follow passion projects, such as reducing tech debt or optimizing systems. Top companies build in extra buffer time to allow engineers to try new languages or tools that aren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily \u0026ldquo;in scope.\u0026rdquo; By the same token, however, engineers expect clear targets and rapid feedback loops to let them know if they\u0026rsquo;re hitting their marks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating an environment of \u0026ldquo;psychological safety\u0026rdquo; (where developers feel safe raising issues quickly, for example) is also an important element of an engineering culture and is the \u003ca href=\"/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance\"\u003enumber-one enabler in terms of technology\u0026rsquo;s impact on business performance\u003c/a\u003e. Tech leaders can role-model specific behaviors, such as demonstrating concern for team members as individuals rather than just employees and actively soliciting their input.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e9. Stop turning great engineers into bad managers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t expect your engineers to aspire to become people managers. More than two-thirds of developers, in fact, don\u0026rsquo;t want to.[[footnote 10]] These experts instead prefer to keep their craft sharp and pursue ever more sophisticated digital challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this reason, digital organizations often have both managerial and non-managerial career paths for tech talent. Leading companies use lateral career moves to promote career growth and exciting career options. At Amazon, for example, people are encouraged to move across different products, channels, and/or roles to learn new skills and gain expertise in multiple areas of the business. Similarly, at Salesforce, it is common for engineers to move laterally across multiple products to gain experience. The technical track should be organized around clear \u0026ldquo;job architectures\u0026rdquo; and expectations for advancement at each level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e10. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are strategic necessities, not special initiatives\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGender-diverse companies are \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003e25 percent more likely to financially outperform less diverse companies\u003c/a\u003e, while ethnically diverse companies are 36 percent more likely to do so. By the same token, technology talent expects a diverse work environment. We have found, in fact, that prized digital talent will often refuse a job offer or even refuse to apply to companies it perceives as noninclusive. One-third of recruiters say applicants are inquiring about DEI.[[footnote 11]] It\u0026rsquo;s worth asking: Does your leadership team reflect sufficient diversity?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this challenge, DEI leaders put structural de-biasing mechanisms in place, such as making sure that DEI is continuously measured and decisions are reviewed\u0026mdash;for example, to track gender diversity in recruiting, retention, evaluation, and pay. They also define a clear technical career path and job structure for key talent pools, focusing on a well-structured path to first- and second-level manager positions. Top companies supplement this with setting specific goals for hiring by specifying requirements for candidate pools and working to root out unconscious bias. Some are starting to use AI to help eliminate biased language in evaluation criteria and are building both incentives and metrics for leaders to role-model unbiased behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is virtually impossible to imagine a business today succeeding without a strong base of tech talent. Only by accepting that overriding reality and making an all-out push to acquire the right tech talent can companies expect to capture the value that digital promises.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Authors":"{1C9D21F3-FC67-4426-8C3A-676FE8604551}|{D9DB443F-EC06-4E8A-8786-96D91E33BD50}|{5FA72AE9-1863-470C-A5CF-C030AA40A396}|{AF460AD5-536D-45DF-8004-50A8AF7D771E}","UseEnhancedAuthors":{"value":false},"Acknowledgements":{"value":""},"About The Authors":{"value":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/sven-blumberg\"\u003eSven Blumberg\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a senior partner in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Istanbul office, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/ranja-reda-kouba\"\u003eRanja Reda Kouba\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is an associate partner in the Vienna office, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/suman-thareja\"\u003eSuman Thareja\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in the New Jersey office, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/anna-wiesinger\"\u003eAnna Wiesinger\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in the D\u0026uuml;sseldorf office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe authors wish to thank Oliver Bossert, Santiago Comella-Dorda, Valerie Hoening, Peter Jacobs, Teresa Keller, Melanie Krawina, Ireen Kulish, Christian Lilley, Hannah Mayer, Remy Paternoster, Angelika Reich, Pamela Simon, and Henning Soller for their contributions to this article.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Hide ByLine":{"value":false},"Related Articles":"{972E5331-22AF-4CC5-BE63-7CECE9F6535B}|{7742F58B-1E90-4CB0-A5FA-E06188DC77D2}|{783F508C-8F93-4E55-8C8F-6A3D741AEAC5}","Ceros Render Mode":null,"Ceros Background Color":null,"Exclude from ClientLink":{"value":false},"Mobile Ready":{"value":true},"Exclude from RSS":{"value":false},"Apple News Article ID":{"value":"e59c0266-1765-41b9-b3ba-b54c36361e23"},"For Clients Only":{"value":false},"Primary Destination":[],"Closer Tout Text":{"value":""},"Contributory Practice":"{70076EDF-2F3D-4F7B-848F-5CDEF2E12C10}","Tout Text":{"value":""},"Source Publication":null,"Article Type":{"name":"Article","displayName":"Article","id":"{0ABBC29E-46EE-470B-A93B-C31F735E753A}","fields":{}},"Thumbnail Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Featured Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Browse Image Mobile":{"value":{}},"Interactive Content":{"value":""},"Call to Action for E-mail":{"value":"Don’t miss out"},"InteractiveToUse":null,"IsFullScreenInteractive":{"value":false},"EnableArticleComponents":{"value":false},"Show Social Share Footer":{"value":false},"Five Fifty Related Items":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Dek":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Dek":{"value":""},"CTA Links":{"value":[]},"Related Articles Title":{"value":""},"Five Fifty Branding Title":{"value":""},"External Link Thumbnail":{"value":{}},"Five-Fifty article background color":{"value":""},"Video Player Id":{"value":""},"Video Id":{"value":""},"Full Report PDF":{"value":null},"Hide Hero":{"value":false},"Hero Image Top Offset":{"value":""},"Executive Summary PDF":{"value":null},"Appendix PDF":{"value":null},"Has Special Report":{"value":false},"Article PDF":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/mckinsey digital/our insights/tech talent tectonics ten new realities finding keeping developing talent/tech-talent-tectonics-ten-new-realities-for-finding-keeping-and-developing-talent.pdf","name":"Tech-talent-tectonics-Ten-new-realities-for-finding-keeping-and-developing-talent","displayName":"Tech-talent-tectonics-Ten-new-realities-for-finding-keeping-and-developing-talent","title":"","keywords":"","description":"","extension":"pdf","mimeType":"application/pdf","size":"5383311","pageCount":"10","thumbnailImageSrc":"/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/mckinsey digital/our insights/tech talent tectonics ten new realities finding keeping developing talent/tech-talent-tectonics-ten-new-realities-for-finding-keeping-and-developing-talent_thumbnail.jpeg"}},"Briefing Note PDF":{"value":null},"Discussion Papers PDF":{"value":null},"Research Preview PDF":{"value":null},"Last Sync Timestamp":{"value":"2022-09-22T04:27:14Z"},"Last Sync By":{"value":"sitecore\\matt_baumer"},"Standard Image":{"value":{"src":"/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/mckinsey digital/our insights/tech talent tectonics ten new realities finding keeping developing talent/digital-techtalent9-1536x1536.jpeg","alt":"Tech talent tectonics: Ten new realities for finding, keeping, and developing talent","width":"1536","height":"1536","Description":""}},"SEO Title":{"value":"How to find, keep, and develop tech talent"},"Display Date":{"value":"2022-04-14T00:00:00Z"},"Description":{"value":"Large incumbents can compete successfully for tech talent\u0026mdash;but only if they\u0026rsquo;re ready to completely rethink their entire HR approach.

Women leaders are switching jobs at the highest rates we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\u0026mdash;and at higher rates than men in leadership. That could have serious implications for companies. Women are already significantly underrepresented in leadership. For years, fewer women have risen through the ranks because of the \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; at the first step up to management. Now, companies are struggling to hold onto the relatively few women leaders they have. And all of these dynamics are even more pronounced for women of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe reasons women leaders are stepping away from their companies are telling. Women leaders are just as ambitious as men, but at many companies, they face headwinds that signal it will be harder to advance. They\u0026rsquo;re more likely to experience belittling microaggressions, such as having their judgment questioned or being mistaken for someone more junior. They\u0026rsquo;re doing more to support employee well-being and foster inclusion, but this critical work is spreading them thin and going mostly unrewarded. And finally, it\u0026rsquo;s increasingly important to women leaders that they work for companies that prioritize flexibility, employee well-being, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf companies don\u0026rsquo;t take action, they risk losing not only their current women leaders but also the next generation of women leaders.

For every 100 men who are promoted from entry-level roles to manager positions, only 87 women are promoted, and only 82 women of color are promoted (Exhibit 2). As a result, men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, and women can never catch up. There are simply too few women to promote to senior leadership positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20222]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. More women leaders are leaving their companies.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Now companies have a new pipeline problem. Women leaders are leaving their companies at the highest rate we\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\u0026mdash;and at a much higher rate than men leaders. To put the scale of the problem in perspective: for every woman at the director level who gets promoted to the next level, two women directors are choosing to leave their company (Exhibit 3).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20223]]\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy women leaders are switching jobs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen leaders are demanding more from their companies, and they\u0026rsquo;re increasingly willing to switch jobs to get it. Three primary factors are driving their decisions to leave:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Women leaders want to advance, but they face stronger headwinds than men.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Women leaders are as likely as men at their level to want to be promoted and aspire to senior-level roles. In many companies, however, they experience microaggressions that undermine their authority and signal that it will be harder for them to advance. For example, they are far more likely than men in leadership to have colleagues imply that they aren\u0026rsquo;t qualified for their jobs. And women leaders are twice as likely as men leaders to be mistaken for someone more junior. Women leaders are also more likely to report that personal characteristics, such as their gender or being a parent, have played a role in them being denied or passed over for a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Story 20221]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Women leaders are overworked and underrecognized.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Compared with men at their level, women leaders do more to support employee well-being and foster DEI\u0026mdash;work that dramatically improves retention and employee satisfaction but is not formally rewarded in most companies. Indeed, 40 percent of women leaders say their DEI work isn\u0026rsquo;t acknowledged at all in performance reviews. Spending time and energy on work that isn\u0026rsquo;t recognized could make it harder for women leaders to advance. It also means that women leaders are stretched thinner than men in leadership; not surprisingly, 43 percent of women leaders are burned out, compared with only 31 percent of men at their level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e3. Women leaders are seeking a different culture of work.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women leaders are significantly more likely than men leaders to leave their jobs because they want more flexibility or because they want to work for a company that is more committed to employee well-being and DEI. And over the last two years, these factors have only become more important to women leaders: they are more than 1.5 times as likely as men at their level to have left a previous job because they wanted to work for a company that was more committed to DEI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe factors that prompt current women leaders to leave their companies are even more important to the next generation of women leaders. Young women care deeply about the opportunity to advance\u0026mdash;more than two-thirds of women under 30 want to be senior leaders. Young women are also more likely than current women leaders to say they\u0026rsquo;re increasingly prioritizing flexibility and company commitment to well-being and DEI (Exhibit 4). Companies that don\u0026rsquo;t take action may struggle to recruit and retain the next generation of women leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20224]]\n\u003ch2\u003eAn intersectional look at women\u0026rsquo;s experiences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany women experience bias not only because of their gender but also because of their race, sexual orientation, a disability, or other aspects of their identity\u0026mdash;and the compounded discrimination can be much greater than the sum of its parts. As a result, these groups of women often experience more microaggressions and face more barriers to advancement. Notably, women of color are more ambitious despite getting less support: 41 percent of women of color want to be top executives, compared with 27 percent of White women. It\u0026rsquo;s critical that companies and coworkers are aware of these dynamics, so they can more effectively promote equity and inclusion for all women. Although no study can fully capture the experiences of women with traditionally marginalized identities, this year\u0026rsquo;s findings point to these distinct experiences:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eLatinas and Black women\u003c/em\u003e are less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to report their manager supports their career development.

A vast majority of employees want to work for companies that offer remote- or hybrid-work options. Only 7 percent of companies plan to pull back on remote and hybrid work in the next year, and 32 percent say these options are likely to expand. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eChoice is critical.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women employees  who can choose to work in the arrangement they prefer\u0026mdash;whether remote or on-site\u0026mdash;are less burned out, happier in their jobs, and much less likely to consider leaving their companies (Exhibit 5). This points to the importance of giving employees as much agency and choice when possible; a \u0026ldquo;one size fits all\u0026rdquo; approach to flexible work won\u0026rsquo;t work for all employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20225]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe option to work remotely is especially important to women. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eOnly one in ten women wants to work mostly on-site, and many women point to remote- and hybrid-work options as one of their top reasons for joining or staying with an organization. These preferences are about more than flexibility. When women work remotely at least some of the time, they experience fewer microaggressions and higher levels of psychological safety. The decrease in microaggressions is especially pronounced for women of color, LGBTQ+ women, and women with disabilities\u0026mdash;groups who typically face more demeaning and othering behavior (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;Remote-work options are especially critical for women with disabilities\u0026rdquo;). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar 20221]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlthough remote and hybrid work are delivering real benefits, they may also be creating new challenges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Many employees\u0026mdash;and especially women employees\u0026mdash;are seeing important benefits from remote and hybrid work. Companies that offer flexible work options have also been able to diversify their talent pipelines; 71 percent of HR leaders say remote work has helped their organizations hire and retain more employees from diverse backgrounds. However, a majority of companies are concerned that employees who work remotely feel less connected to their teams and say that remote and hybrid work are placing additional demands on managers. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible that employees who work primarily from home\u0026mdash;who are more likely to be women\u0026mdash;will get fewer opportunities for recognition and advancement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemote and hybrid work can offer a reprieve from bias, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a substitute for systemic change. On one hand, it\u0026rsquo;s positive that women who work remotely are experiencing fewer microaggressions. On the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s deeply problematic. Regardless of where they work, all women deserve to feel valued and included. Companies cannot rely on remote and hybrid work as a solution; they need to invest in creating a truly inclusive culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs companies continue to navigate this transition, there are three key things they should consider. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Story 20223]]\n\u003ch3\u003eFive steps companies can take to navigate the shift to remote and hybrid work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not enough to tweak old policies and practices; companies that are transitioning to remote and hybrid work need to fundamentally rethink how work is done. To start, companies would be well served to focus their efforts in five areas:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Clearly communicate plans and guidelines for flexible work. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAs remote- and hybrid-work policies continue to evolve, it\u0026rsquo;s important for companies to share guidelines about who can work remotely and why so people don\u0026rsquo;t feel they\u0026rsquo;re being treated unfairly. It\u0026rsquo;s also important that companies provide clear guidelines to help employees navigate the day-to-day complexities of remote and hybrid work\u0026mdash;for example, by establishing specific windows during which meetings can be scheduled and employees in different time zones are expected to be available.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e2. Gather regular feedback from employees. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOnly about half of companies have surveyed employees on their preferences for remote and hybrid work over the past year. As companies roll out new remote- and hybrid-work norms, they will want to keep a regular pulse on what\u0026rsquo;s working for employees and what needs to be improved. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Invest in fostering employee connectedness.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e This means being intentional about working norms\u0026mdash;for example, having everyone join meetings via videoconference so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier for employees to participate when they are working remotely. It also means finding new ways to foster camaraderie and connection, such as making creative use of technology to facilitate watercooler-style interactions and team celebrations. Companies could also benefit from dedicating resources to team bonding events and, whether they\u0026rsquo;re virtual or in person, taking special care to make sure that all employees feel included and that events are accessible to everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Be purposeful about in-person work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e Many employees don\u0026rsquo;t want to come into the office to do work they can just as easily do at home. In light of this, many companies are starting to refocus in-person work on activities that take advantage of being together, such as high-level planning, learning and development training, and bursts of heavy collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Make sure the playing field is level.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e It\u0026rsquo;s important that employees who choose remote- or hybrid-work options get the same support and opportunities as on-site employees. Managers play a central role here, and many could benefit from additional training on how to foster remote and hybrid employees\u0026rsquo; career development and minimize flexibility stigma. Equal access to mentorship and sponsorship is also key, yet less than half of companies offer virtual mentorship and sponsorship programs. Finally, companies can put safeguards in place to ensure employees who take advantage of remote- and hybrid-work options aren\u0026rsquo;t disadvantaged in performance reviews. This means communicating to managers that employees should be evaluated based on measurable results\u0026mdash;not when or where they work\u0026mdash;and closely tracking performance ratings and promotions for remote, hybrid, and on-site employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe importance of managers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers play an essential role in shaping women\u0026rsquo;s\u0026mdash;and all employees\u0026rsquo;\u0026mdash;work experiences. When managers invest in people management and DEI, women are happier and less burned out. They\u0026rsquo;re also more likely to recommend their company as a good place to work and less likely to think about leaving their jobs, which translates to better recruiting and higher retention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpectations of managers have risen over the past two years: the shift to remote and hybrid work has made management more challenging, and a majority of HR leaders say their company now expects managers to do more to promote inclusion and support employees\u0026rsquo; career development and well-being. But relatively few companies are training managers adequately to meet these new demands, and even fewer recognize DEI work and good people management in managers\u0026rsquo; performance reviews. This disconnect is apparent in the way managers show up. Only about half of women say their manager regularly encourages respectful behavior on their team, and less than half say their manager shows interest in their career and helps them manage their workload (Exhibit 6).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20226]]\n\u003ch3\u003eHow companies can equip, motivate, and reward good managers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin to close the gap between what\u0026rsquo;s expected of managers and how they show up, companies could focus on two key objectives:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Give managers more training and support. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAlthough a majority of companies provide general training for managers, far fewer address specifics that are critical to managing teams today, such as how to minimize burnout and ensure promotions are equitable. Research shows that when training focuses on concrete topics like these, it leads to better results.[[Footnote 3]] Companies could also benefit from stepping back to make sure people managers have the time and resources they need to do their jobs well. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Hold managers accountable and reward those who excel. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s increasingly common for employees to review their manager\u0026rsquo;s performance, and prompts to gather more expansive input can be added to employee evaluation forms. Many companies track attrition rates, promotion rates, and other career outcomes and conduct surveys to measure employee satisfaction and well-being. Insights from these processes can be built into managers\u0026rsquo; performance evaluations. In addition, companies can take steps to signal their expectations and reward results more clearly, such as by sharing well-being and diversity metrics with all employees and publicly acknowledging managers who stand out for their efforts to support employees and foster inclusion on their teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRecommendations for companies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make meaningful and sustainable progress toward gender equality, companies should consider focusing on two broad goals: getting more women into leadership and retaining the women leaders they already have. That will require pushing beyond common practices. Companies with better representation of women, especially women of color, are going further. For example, they\u0026rsquo;re doubling down on setting goals and holding leaders accountable. They\u0026rsquo;re offering more specific and actionable training so that managers are better equipped to support their teams. And they\u0026rsquo;re offering a constellation of benefits to improve women\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day work experiences including, flexibility, emergency childcare benefits, and mental-health support. Companies that want to see better results would benefit from following their lead and break new ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost companies also need to take specific, highly targeted steps to fix their broken rung. This starts with identifying where the largest gap in promotions is for women in their pipeline.

This is an encouraging sign\u0026mdash;and worth celebrating after an incredibly difficult year. But there are also persistent gaps in the pipeline: promotions at the first step up to manager are not equitable, and women of color lose ground in representation at every level. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is still a \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; at the first step up to manager. Since 2016, we have seen the same trend: women are promoted to manager at far lower rates than men, and this makes it nearly impossible for companies to lay a foundation for sustained progress at more senior levels. Additionally, the gains in representation for women overall haven\u0026rsquo;t translated to gains for women of color. Women of color continue to lose ground at every step in the pipeline\u0026mdash;between the entry level and the C-suite, the representation of women of color drops off by more than 75 percent. As a result, women of color account for only 4 percent of C-suite leaders, a number that hasn\u0026rsquo;t moved significantly in the past three years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe representation of women is only part of the story. The pandemic continues to take a toll on employees, and especially women. Women are even more burned out now than they were a year ago, and burnout is escalating much faster among women than among men. One in three women says that they have considered downshifting their career or leaving the workforce this year, compared with one in four who said this a few months into the pandemic. Additionally, four in ten women have considered leaving their company or switching jobs\u0026mdash;and high employee turnover in recent months suggests that many of them are following through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s not yet clear how the events of the past year and a half will affect the representation of women in corporate America in the long run, it\u0026rsquo;s very clear that this crisis is far from over.

As a result, men outnumber women significantly at the manager level, which means that there are far fewer women to promote to higher levels. The broken rung likely explains why representation of women at the senior-manager, director, and vice-president levels has improved more slowly than the pipeline overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20213]]\n\u003ch3\u003eWomen are more burned out\u0026mdash;and more so than men\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen are even more burned out now than they were a year ago, and the gap in burnout between women and men has almost doubled (Exhibit 4).

The COVID-19 crisis shook the economy and turned people\u0026rsquo;s lives upside down, both at work and at home. A heightened focus on racism and racial violence triggered a reckoning on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Companies\u0026rsquo; current priorities reflect these changes: an overwhelming majority of companies say that managers\u0026rsquo; efforts to promote employee well-being are critically important and that DEI is one of their key areas of focus. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen leaders are meeting this moment and taking on the work that comes with it (Exhibit 5). They are doing more than men in similar positions in supporting the people on their teams\u0026mdash;for example, by helping team members navigate work\u0026ndash;life challenges, ensuring that their workloads are manageable, and checking in on their overall well-being. Women leaders also spend more time than men on DEI work that falls outside their formal job responsibilities, such as supporting employee resource groups and recruiting employees from underrepresented groups. Senior-level women are twice as likely as senior-level men to dedicate time to these tasks at least weekly. And finally, women leaders are showing up as more active allies to women of color.

But for women of color and women with other traditionally marginalized identities, these experiences are more frequent and reflect a wider range of biases (Exhibit 6). For example, Black women are almost four times as likely as White women\u0026mdash;and Latinas and Asian women are two to three times as likely\u0026mdash;to hear people express surprise at their language skills or other abilities, and we see a similar pattern for other common microaggressions, as well.  \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20216]]\n\u003cp\u003eLGBTQ+ women and women with disabilities are also significantly more likely than women overall to experience microaggressions.

Although White employees recognize that speaking out against discrimination is critical, they are less likely to recognize the importance of more proactive, sustained steps such as advocating for new opportunities for women of color and stepping up as mentors and sponsors.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20217]]\n\u003ch3\u003eWomen who are \u0026lsquo;Onlys\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;double Onlys\u0026rsquo; have a much worse experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who are \u0026ldquo;Onlys\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;meaning, they are often one of the only people of their race or gender in the room at work\u0026mdash;have especially difficult day-to-day experiences. Onlys stand out, and because of that, they tend to be more heavily scrutinized. Their successes and failures are often put under a microscope, and they are more likely to encounter comments and behavior that reduce them to negative stereotypes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only for one dimension of identity is already incredibly difficult. But women of color sometimes have to contend with being Onlys on two dimensions: both as the only woman in the room and as the only person of their race in the room. \u0026ldquo;Double Onlys\u0026rdquo; face even more bias, discrimination, and pressure to perform, and they are even more likely to be experiencing burnout. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only or double Only can dramatically compound other challenges women are facing at work. Mothers of young children are one example of this\u0026mdash;they already face more bias and barriers than fathers and women overall, and when they are often the only woman in the room in their workplace, their experience is even more difficult. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared with mothers of young children who regularly work with other women, those who are Onlys are significantly more likely to experience burnout or to consider leaving their companies. They are also more likely to feel judged or to be worried about how their career might be affected if they take advantage of options that make it easier to balance work and life, such as working from home or working nonstandard hours. And they are less likely to feel comfortable sharing their personal challenges with colleagues, which means they\u0026rsquo;re less likely to get the support they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The road to progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough we have seen important gains since 2016, women are still significantly underrepresented at all levels of management. And on top of this, women continue to have a worse day-to-day experience at work. Women are more likely than men to have their competence questioned and their authority undermined, and women of color and other women with traditionally marginalized identities are especially likely to face disrespectful and \u0026ldquo;othering\u0026rdquo; behavior. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo drive change, companies need to invest deeply in all aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This starts with taking bold steps to ensure that women of diverse identities are well represented, but diversity of numbers isn\u0026rsquo;t enough on its own. Companies also need to create a culture that fully leverages the benefits of diversity\u0026mdash;one in which women, and all employees, feel comfortable bringing their unique ideas, perspectives, and experiences to the table. When women are respected and their contributions are valued, they are more likely to be happy in their jobs and to feel connected to their coworkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough there are no quick fixes to these challenges, there are steps companies can and should take. First, they need to put more practices in place to ensure promotions are equitable. Companies are currently taking more steps to reduce bias in hiring, and they need to apply that same rigor to the performance review process. For example, less than half of companies provide bias training for employees involved in performance reviews, compared with two-thirds that do so for hiring. Expanding this training would likely lead to better promotion outcomes for women and other employees from underrepresented groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond, companies need to track representation and hiring and promotion outcomes more fully. Although most companies track representation for women overall, far fewer do this for women of color, which means women of color are often overlooked in diversity metrics. Companies would also be well-served to track hiring and promotions to determine whether women, and especially women of color, are being hired and promoted at similar rates to other employees. If they see gaps at particular levels or in certain functions, they may need to make adjustments, including doubling down on best practices in those areas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo accelerate progress for all women, on all fronts, companies need to double their efforts when it comes to accountability. Despite saying that gender and racial diversity are among their most important business priorities,  only two-thirds of companies hold senior leaders accountable for progress on diversity goals, and less than a third hold managers\u0026mdash;who play a critical role in hiring and promotions decisions\u0026mdash;accountable. Moreover, among companies that say they hold leaders accountable, less than half factor progress on diversity metrics into performance reviews, and far fewer provide financial incentives for meeting goals. This means their accountability isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to material consequences\u0026mdash;and it\u0026rsquo;s therefore much less likely to produce results. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e How companies can make their workplaces more inclusive\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies still have work to do to create a culture that fully embraces and leverages diversity. HR leaders say that two things are critical to this effort: senior-level sponsorship and high employee engagement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior leaders need to fully and publicly support DEI efforts. When senior-level employees model inclusive leadership and actively participate in training and events related to DEI, they send a powerful signal about the importance of this work. Senior leaders also play a key role in ensuring that DEI initiatives are appropriately resourced across their organizations. This is just another reason why it is critically important to hold leaders accountable for progress on DEI efforts and to formalize this accountability. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut women\u0026rsquo;s day-to-day experiences are shaped primarily by their interactions with managers and colleagues, which means that deep cultural change is possible only if all employees are empowered to be part of the solution. This starts with raising awareness. Employees need to understand the barriers that women face\u0026mdash;particularly women with traditionally marginalized identities\u0026mdash;and the benefits of a more inclusive culture. Companies can promote awareness by sharing data on the experiences of women in their organizations, bringing in thought-provoking speakers, and encouraging employees to openly share their experience and ideas for advancing DEI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor employees to move from awareness to action, training is an important step. The number of employees who receive training on bias, antiracism, and allyship is on the rise\u0026mdash;but only 34 percent of employees have received antiracism training in the past year, and just 14 percent have received allyship training. This suggests that companies may need to take bolder steps to encourage participation, such as offering incentives or making training mandatory. They should also invest in ongoing employee education; it takes consistent reinforcement to reshape deep-rooted biases and change behavior, so a one-and-done approach to training is not enough. And companies need to be sure that they are incorporating the new ideas and tools from training into everyday processes, too. For example, before hiring and promotion processes begin, companies can send out reminders about how bias can influence evaluations; research shows that this simple practice can improve outcomes for women and other people from underrepresented groups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, companies should clearly communicate what is expected of employees and what it means to have an inclusive culture. Building this thinking into company values is a good place to start, but organizations would benefit from articulating the specific behaviors and actions that promote inclusion. In addition to signaling the importance of this work, clear guidelines will help set managers and all employees up for success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e How companies can begin to address burnout\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies have demonstrated strong commitment to employee well-being over the past year. They have taken a wide range of steps to help employees weather the pandemic, including increasing mental-health benefits, adding support for parents and caregivers, and offering more paid leave. These steps have led to better outcomes for all employees, and they have likely played a key role in allowing many women to remain in the workforce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, burnout is still on the rise, especially among women. There is no easy fix, so continued investment will be critical. Companies also should look for opportunities to expand on the successful policies and programs they have already established and try new approaches. It\u0026rsquo;s also important that companies establish new norms and systems to improve employees\u0026rsquo; everyday work experiences\u0026mdash;even with all the right policies and programs, employees will continue to struggle if the cadence and expectations of their work feel untenable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross all of their efforts to combat burnout, companies would benefit from embracing experimentation. There is no playbook for this unprecedented moment, but companies can make strides by listening closely to employees, exploring creative solutions, and trying something different if a new norm or program falls flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs companies embrace flexibility, they also need to set clear boundaries\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past 18 months, companies have embraced flexibility. More than three-quarters of senior HR leaders say that allowing employees to work flexible hours is one of the most effective things they\u0026rsquo;ve done to improve employee well-being, and there are clear signs it\u0026rsquo;s working. Employees with more flexibility to take time off and step away from work are much less likely to be burned out, and very few employees are concerned that requesting flexible work arrangements has affected their opportunity to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, many companies are missing a crucial piece: without clear boundaries, flexible work can quickly turn into \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; work. More than a third of employees feel like they need to be available for work 24/7, and almost half believe they need to work long hours to get ahead. Employees who feel this way are much more likely to be burned out and to consider leaving their companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that so many employees feel \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; signals that companies need to define expectations more explicitly. Right now, many companies are leaving it to employees to establish their own boundaries when they work remotely or work flexible hours\u0026mdash;and while employees should be empowered to carve out personal time, companies have a responsibility to put formal boundaries in place across the organization. Only one in five employees says that their company has told them that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to respond to nonurgent requests outside of traditional work hours, and only one in three has received guidance around blocking off personal time on their calendar. Establishing or reinforcing work norms such as these would go a long way toward reducing the feeling of being always on.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[PullQuote 3]]\n\u003cp\u003eAs companies navigate the transition to increased remote and hybrid work\u0026mdash;with more employees working different schedules across different time zones\u0026mdash;the risk of feeling always on will likely increase. Establishing clear boundaries now can help companies ease this transition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagers have an important role to play in fighting burnout\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers are on the front lines of employees\u0026rsquo; day-to-day experiences, which means their actions have a significant impact on employee burnout and well-being. To improve outcomes, managers should focus their attention in three key areas: modeling work\u0026ndash;life boundaries, supporting employee well-being, and ensuring that performance is evaluated based on results. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployees often look to their manager to understand unspoken company norms and expectations. This means that managers need to respect company-wide boundaries around flexible work. For example, if employees aren\u0026rsquo;t expected to respond to emails during certain hours, managers need to abide by that norm. Managers can further reinforce the importance of these norms by celebrating employees who push back when boundaries are crossed and by encouraging candid conversations and problem solving across the team if boundaries start to erode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo underscore that employees are not expected to be \u0026ldquo;always on,\u0026rdquo; companies and managers need to work together to make sure all employees are evaluated based on results rather than when or where they work. A results-oriented lens is critical in formal performance reviews, and managers should be mindful of the day-to-day feedback they deliver to ensure they aren\u0026rsquo;t inadvertently signaling that long hours and face time are unspoken measures of performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also important that managers actively monitor employees for signs of burnout and adjust workloads as needed. Although some managers are stepping up on this front\u0026mdash;especially women\u0026mdash;a majority of employees report that their manager doesn\u0026rsquo;t check in on their well-being or help them shift priorities and deadlines on a regular basis. This suggests that managers need to touch base with their teams more consistently, and that these check-ins should be more explicit. Prompting employees to rate their level of stress and exhaustion on a one-to-ten scale, as opposed to generally asking them how they\u0026rsquo;re doing, creates more space for open, honest discussion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, companies need to impress upon managers that the work they do to support employee well-being is critical to the health and success of the business. For this work to feel like a real priority, it needs to be tied to concrete outcomes for managers, including performance ratings and compensation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLooking ahead\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate challenge for companies is to help employees get through the pandemic\u0026mdash;and the work to get this right is far from over. But companies also need to start to plan for the future. The disruption of the past year and half is driving a fundamental change in the way people work. Companies are embracing flexibility and remote work at levels that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago\u0026mdash;and employees are fully on board. It will take time for the full impact of the pandemic to come into focus, but one thing is clear: hybrid work is here to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s unclear is whether companies can capitalize on this seismic shift\u0026mdash;and the growing cultural focus on employee well-being and racial equity\u0026mdash;to create more caring, connected, and inclusive workplaces. This is a rare opportunity to change the workplace for good. Doing so will require pushing for bigger gains in representation of women, recognizing and rewarding women\u0026rsquo;s contributions as people-focused leaders and champions of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and doing the deep cultural work necessary to create a workplace where all women, and all employees, feel like they belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will demand a level of investment and creativity that may not have seemed possible before the pandemic, but companies have shown what they can do when change is critical. Now, they need to treat women\u0026rsquo;s equality and diversity, equity, and inclusion with the same sense of urgency\u0026mdash;and they need to reward the leaders taking us into the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is an edited extract from Women in the Workplace 2021, a study undertaken by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org.

This effort, conducted in partnership with LeanIn.Org, tracks the progress of women in corporate America. The data set this year reflects contributions from 317 companies that participated in the study and more than 40,000 people surveyed on their workplace experiences; more than 45 in-depth interviews were also conducted to dive deeper on the issues. These efforts were in the field from June to August of 2020, although the pipeline data represents employer-provided information from calendar year 2019. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar author]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe events of 2020 have turned workplaces upside down. Under the highly challenging circumstances of \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis\"\u003ethe COVID-19 pandemic\u003c/a\u003e, many employees are struggling to do their jobs. Many feel like they\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;always on\u0026rdquo; now that the boundaries between work and home have blurred. They\u0026rsquo;re worried about their family\u0026rsquo;s health and finances. Burnout is a real issue. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen in particular have been negatively impacted. Women\u0026mdash;especially women of color\u0026mdash;are more likely to have been laid off or furloughed during the COVID-19 crisis,[[footnote 5]] stalling their careers and jeopardizing their financial security. The pandemic has intensified challenges that women already faced. Working mothers have always worked a \u0026ldquo;double shift\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a full day of work, followed by hours spent caring for children and doing household labor. Now the supports that made this possible\u0026mdash;including school and childcare\u0026mdash;have been upended. Meanwhile, Black women already faced more barriers to advancement than most other employees.[[footnote 6]] Today they\u0026rsquo;re also coping with the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 \u003ca href=\"/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-investing-in-black-lives-and-livelihoods\"\u003eon the Black community\u003c/a\u003e. And the emotional toll of repeated instances of racial violence falls heavily on their shoulders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of these dynamics, more than one in four women are contemplating what many would have considered unthinkable just six months ago: downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce completely. This is an emergency for corporate America. Companies risk losing women in leadership\u0026mdash;and future women leaders\u0026mdash;and unwinding years of painstaking progress toward gender diversity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crisis also represents an opportunity. If companies make significant investments in building a more flexible and empathetic workplace\u0026mdash;and there are signs that this is starting to happen\u0026mdash;they can retain the employees most affected by today\u0026rsquo;s crises \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e nurture a culture in which women have equal opportunity to achieve their potential over the long term. The rest of this article summarizes the report\u0026rsquo;s main findings (and you can go even deeper with a \u003ca href=\"/about-us/new-at-mckinsey-blog/how-are-working-women-doing-during-covid-19-our-women-in-the-workplace-study-explores\"\u003ebehind-the-scenes chat\u003c/a\u003e with one of the report\u0026rsquo;s coauthors on our blog).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP 1]]\n\u003ch2\u003eProgress toward gender parity remains slow \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the beginning of 2020, the representation of women in corporate America was trending in the right direction. This was most pronounced in senior management: between January 2015 and January 2020, representation of women in senior-vice-president positions grew from 23 to 28 percent, and representation in the C-suite grew from 17 to 21 percent (Exhibit 1). Women remained dramatically underrepresented\u0026mdash;particularly women of color\u0026mdash;but the numbers were slowly improving.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit a]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe \u0026lsquo;broken rung\u0026rsquo; is still holding women back\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite gains for women in leadership, the \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; was still a major barrier in 2019. For the sixth year in a row, women continued to lose ground at the first step up to manager. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 85 women were promoted\u0026mdash;and this gap was even larger for some women: only 58 Black women and 71 Latinas were promoted. As a result, women remained significantly outnumbered in entry-level management at the beginning of 2020\u0026mdash;they held just 38 percent of manager-level positions, while men held 62 percent (Exhibit 2). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit b]]\n\u003ch2\u003eThe COVID-19 crisis could set women back half a decade\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eBefore this year, Women in the Workplace research had consistently found that women and men leave their companies at comparable rates. However, due to the challenges created by the COVID-19 crisis, as many as two million women are considering leaving the workforce[[footnote 7]] . If these women feel forced to leave the workplace, we\u0026rsquo;ll end up with far fewer women in leadership\u0026mdash;and far fewer women on track to be future leaders. All the progress we\u0026rsquo;ve seen over the past six years could be erased (see sidebar, \u0026ldquo;A closer look at the challenges that could force women out of the workforce\u0026rdquo;). \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies are stepping up\u0026mdash;but many aren\u0026rsquo;t addressing the likely underlying causes of stress and burnout\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have taken important steps to support employees during the COVID-19 crisis. They are sharing valuable information with employees, including updates on the business\u0026rsquo;s financial situation and details about paid-leave policies. Almost all companies are providing tools and resources to help employees work remotely. Many have also expanded services related to mental health, such as counseling and enrichment programs, and offered training to help managers support employees\u0026rsquo; mental health and well-being. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Disruptor1UP 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, fewer companies have taken steps to adjust the norms and expectations that are most likely responsible for employee stress and burnout. Less than a third of companies have adjusted their performance review criteria to account for the challenges created by the pandemic, and only about half have updated employees on their plans for performance reviews or their productivity expectations during COVID-19. That means many employees\u0026mdash;especially parents and caregivers\u0026mdash;are facing the choice between falling short of pre-pandemic expectations that may now be unrealistic, or pushing themselves to keep up an unsustainable pace (Exhibit 3). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit c]]\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the issue of financial anxiety. Companies are putting policies and programs in place to ease employees\u0026rsquo; financial stress. More than half have increased paid leave\u0026mdash;which is an important option for employees who need time off but can\u0026rsquo;t afford to miss a paycheck\u0026mdash;and about a third have added or expanded stipends to offset the costs of working from home. However, companies that are struggling financially may not be able to address the issue employees are most concerned about: the possibility of being laid off or furloughed. Sadly, for companies struggling financially or rethinking their business, it may not be possible to reassure their employees on this front. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCOVID-19 could push many mothers out of the workforce\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecades of research shows that women do significantly more housework and childcare than men\u0026mdash;so much so that women who are employed full-time are often said to be working a \u0026ldquo;double shift.\u0026rdquo;[[footnote 8]] Now women, and mothers in particular, are taking on an even heavier load. Mothers are more than three times as likely as fathers to be responsible for most of the housework and caregiving during the pandemic. In fact, they\u0026rsquo;re 1.5 times more likely than fathers to be spending an additional three or more hours per day on housework and childcare (Exhibit 4). \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit d]]\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, for the one in five mothers who don\u0026rsquo;t live with a spouse or partner, the challenges are even greater. Unsurprisingly, single mothers are much more likely than other parents to do all the housework and childcare in their household, and they are also more likely to say that financial insecurity is one of their top concerns during the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOne in three mothers have considered leaving the workforce or downshifting their careers because of COVID-19\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the enormous challenges mothers are facing at work and at home, two things should come as no surprise: many mothers are considering downshifting their career or leaving the workforce, and mothers are significantly more likely to be thinking about taking these steps than fathers (Exhibit 5). Among mothers who are thinking about downshifting or leaving, a majority cite childcare responsibilities as a primary reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit e]]\n\u003ch2\u003e Companies are at risk of losing women in leadership\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior-level women are under the same pressure to perform right now as senior-level men\u0026mdash;and then some. Women are often held to higher performance standards than men, and they may be more likely to take the blame for failure\u0026mdash;so when the stakes are high, as they are now, senior-level women could face higher criticism and harsher judgement. Senior-level women are also nearly twice as likely as women overall to be \u0026ldquo;Onlys\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;the only or one of the only women in the room at work. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/one-is-the-loneliest-number\"\u003eThat comes with its own challenges\u003c/a\u003e: women who are Onlys are more likely than women who work with other women to feel pressure to work more and to experience microaggressions, including needing to provide additional evidence of their competence. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, senior-level women are significantly more likely than men at the same level to feel burned out, under pressure to work more, and \u0026ldquo;as though they have to be \u0026lsquo;always on.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; And they are 1.5 times more likely than senior-level men to think about downshifting their role or leaving the workforce because of COVID-19. Almost three in four cite burnout as a main reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies can\u0026rsquo;t afford to lose women leaders\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility of losing so many senior-level women is alarming for several reasons. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe financial consequences could be significant. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003eResearch shows\u003c/a\u003e that company profits and share performance can be close to 50 percent higher when women are well represented at the top.[[footnote 9]] Beyond that, senior-level women have a vast and meaningful impact on a company\u0026rsquo;s culture. They are more likely than senior-level men to embrace employee-friendly policies and programs and to champion racial and gender diversity: more than 50 percent of senior-level women say they consistently take a public stand for gender and racial equity at work, compared with about 40 percent of senior-level men (Exhibit 6). And they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to mentor and sponsor other women: 38 percent of senior-level women currently mentor or sponsor one or more women of color, compared with only 23 percent of senior-level men. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf women leaders leave the workforce, women at all levels could lose their most powerful allies and champions. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit f]]\n\u003ch3\u003e Black women are less likely to feel supported at work during COVID-19\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women have always faced huge barriers to advancement. Now, in addition to the heightened pressures that Black women who are mothers and senior leaders are experiencing, they are also dealing with distinct issues because of their race. The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected Black people, and incidents of violence toward Black people in the United States have exacted a heavy emotional and mental toll on Black women. On top of all this, many Black women do not feel supported by managers and coworkers (Exhibit 7).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit g]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThe workplace has always been more unequal for Black women\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared with their colleagues of other races and ethnicities, Black women have always had distinct, and by and large worse, experiences at work. They are promoted more slowly than other groups of employees and are significantly underrepresented in senior leadership. They are less likely than women of other races and ethnicities to say their manager advocates for new opportunities for them. And they have fewer interactions with senior leaders, which means they often don\u0026rsquo;t get the sponsorship and advocacy they need to advance. Given these challenges, it\u0026rsquo;s not surprising that Black women are less likely than employees of other races to report they have equal opportunity to advance at work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women also deal with more day-to-day bias in their workplaces. They face a wider range of microaggressions, from having their judgment questioned to hearing demeaning remarks about themselves or people like them. Additionally, half of Black women are often Onlys for their race. Black women who are Onlys are especially likely to feel scrutinized, under increased pressure to perform, and as if their actions reflect positively or negatively on people like them.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNow, Black women are facing even more challenges\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women are being disproportionately affected by the difficult events of 2020. They are more than twice as likely as women overall to say that the death of a loved one has been one of their biggest challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. And incidents of racial violence across the United States are exacting a heavy emotional toll. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, work would be a supportive place for Black women amid these national and global crises. Unfortunately, for many, that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. Black women are less likely than women overall to report that their manager has inquired about their workload or taken steps to ensure that their work\u0026ndash;life needs are being met.[[footnote 10]] Fewer than one in three Black women report their manager has checked in on them in light of recent racial violence or \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/sustaining-and-strengthening-inclusion-in-our-new-remote-environment\"\u003efostered an inclusive culture\u003c/a\u003e on their team. Plus, Black women are far less likely than White colleagues to say they have strong allies at work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this is having an impact on Black women. They are more likely than employees of other races and ethnicities to feel uncomfortable talking with colleagues about the impact current events have had on their community and \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-hidden-perils-of-unresolved-grief\"\u003eabout their own grief and loss\u003c/a\u003e. They also feel more reluctant to share their thoughts on racial inequity. And compared with other employees, Black women feel more excluded at work and are less likely to say they can bring their whole selves to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow companies can better support Black women\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[Video 2020]]\n\u003cp\u003eBlack women were already having a worse experience in the workplace than most other employees. Now they\u0026rsquo;re facing the same challenges other women are\u0026mdash;plus painful and isolating challenges rooted in racism. To better support Black women, companies need to take action in two critical areas. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Address the distinct challenges of Black women head-on\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to address the distinct experiences of Black women, who face obstacles rooted in both racism and sexism. The first step is making a public and explicit commitment to advancing and supporting Black women. This commitment should be communicated to employees, along with a clear explanation of why it\u0026rsquo;s important. Many employees don\u0026rsquo;t realize that Black women are having a markedly worse experience at work. But for six years, this study has shown this to be true: compared with women of other races and ethnicities, Black women face more systemic barriers, receive less support from managers, and experience more acute discrimination. If employees understand this, they will be more likely to champion the Black women in their organization. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo effectively turn their commitment into action, companies should adopt an intersectional approach to their diversity efforts. Many corporate diversity efforts focus on either race or gender, which means women of color may end up being overlooked. In contrast, when companies set goals and track outcomes by gender and race combined, they can more clearly see how Black women and other women of color are progressing. For example, if companies evaluate access to formal mentorship, sponsorship, and management training this way, Black women are more likely to get equal access to these critical opportunities. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e2. Foster a culture that supports and values Black women\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to foster a culture in which Black women\u0026mdash;and other traditionally marginalized employees\u0026mdash;feel like they belong. There are two equally important parts of this: making it clear that disrespectful behavior won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated and taking proactive steps to make sure that Black women feel valued and welcome. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have specific guidelines for conduct that is not acceptable, which is a good first step. But it\u0026rsquo;s also important to articulate what positive, inclusive behavior looks like and celebrate examples of it in practice. Employees will be better equipped to do their part if they receive antiracism and allyship training; this will give them a more complete understanding of how to combat racial discrimination and how to show up for Black women as allies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to reflect on organizational customs, rituals, and norms to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re inclusive. For example, are Black women being included in informal gatherings? Are team events held in spaces where everyone feels welcome and safe? Gathering input from Black women on what is and isn\u0026rsquo;t working for them is critical to this process\u0026mdash;as is giving Black women a voice in shaping new company norms. The more that companies take into account the unique perspectives and experiences of different groups of employees, the more effectively they can create an inclusive culture. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The path forward\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe choices companies make could shape the workplace for women for decades to come\u0026mdash;for better or for worse. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges facing companies right now are serious. Up to two million women are considering leaving the workforce. The \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; that held millions of women back from being promoted to manager has not been repaired. Black women are dealing with additional challenges\u0026mdash;including long-standing issues of racial bias\u0026mdash;and getting less support from managers and coworkers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two paths ahead. If companies recognize the scale of these problems and do all they can to address them, they can help their employees get through this difficult time and even reinvent the way they work so it\u0026rsquo;s more flexible and sustainable for everyone. If not, the consequences could badly hurt women, business, and the economy as a whole. This moment requires long-term thinking, creativity, strong leadership, and a laser focus on the value of women to their organizations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo retain the women most affected by the challenges of COVID-19, companies need to take steps to reduce the additional pressures they\u0026rsquo;re experiencing. Here are six key areas where companies should focus or expand their efforts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) Make work more sustainable\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sustainable pace of work is essential to helping mothers, senior-level women, and all employees facing burnout get through this crisis. To make this happen, leaders and managers need to look at productivity and performance expectations set before COVID-19 and ask if they\u0026rsquo;re still realistic. They may also need to reset goals, narrow project scopes, or keep the same goals and extend deadlines. Currently, only a small number of managers are doing this. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, companies have found creative ways to give employees extra time off. For example, we\u0026rsquo;ve heard from companies that have offered \u0026ldquo;COVID-19 days\u0026rdquo; to give parents a chance to prepare for the new school year and from companies that close for a few Fridays each quarter to give everyone an opportunity to recharge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Reset norms around flexibility\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOVID-19 has made it much harder for employees to draw clear lines between work and home, and many employees feel like they are \u0026ldquo;always on.\u0026rdquo; Companies should look for ways to reestablish work\u0026ndash;life boundaries. For many, this may require setting new work norms\u0026mdash;for example, establishing set hours for meetings, putting policies in place for responding to emails outside typical business hours, and improving communication about work hours and availability within teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can also encourage employees to set their own boundaries and take full advantage of flexible work options. Even when these options are available, some employees worry there may be a stigma attached to using them. To mitigate this, leaders can assure employees that their performance will be measured based on results\u0026mdash;not when, where, or how many hours they work. Leaders can also communicate their support for workplace flexibility\u0026mdash;57 percent of employees say senior leaders at their company have done this during COVID-19. Better yet, leaders can model flexibility in their own lives, which sends a message to employees that it\u0026rsquo;s OK to take advantage of flexible work options. When employees believe senior leaders are supportive of their flexibility needs, they are less likely to consider downshifting their careers or leaving the workforce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) Take a close look at performance reviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerformance reviews are an important part of running an effective organization and rewarding employees for their contributions. But given the shift to remote work and the heightened challenges employees are coping with in their personal lives, performance criteria set before COVID-19 may no longer be appropriate. Managers can relieve employees\u0026rsquo; stress\u0026mdash;and refocus on key priorities\u0026mdash;by reassessing performance criteria set before the pandemic to make sure those criteria are still attainable. Bringing criteria into line with what employees can reasonably achieve may help to prevent burnout and anxiety\u0026mdash;and this may ultimately lead to better performance and higher productivity.[[footnote 11]] \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4) Take steps to minimize gender bias\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic may be amplifying biases women have faced for years: higher performance standards, harsher judgment for mistakes, and penalties for being mothers and for taking advantage of flexible work options.[[footnote 12]] These biases could show up in new ways during COVID-19: for example, when colleagues see young children playing in the background on video calls; when coworkers assume, consciously or unconsciously, that women are less committed to their jobs; or when managers are evaluating women in performance reviews. Given that managers and team members now have less visibility into their colleagues\u0026rsquo; day-to-day work, they may be more likely to make assumptions about their performance, and this increases the chance of bias creeping in. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo mitigate the biases that women are up against, companies need to make sure that employees are aware of them. Leaders and employees should speak publicly about the potentially outsize impact of bias during COVID-19. \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/focusing-on-what-works-for-workplace-diversity\"\u003eBias training\u003c/a\u003e can also help. In the past year, just one in four employees have participated in unconscious-bias training, and even employees who have participated in the past would benefit from a refresher. And finally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to track outcomes for promotions and raises by gender\u0026mdash;as well as the breakdown of layoffs and furloughs by gender\u0026mdash;to make sure women and men are being treated fairly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5) Adjust policies and programs to better support employees\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have extended policies and programs to support employees during COVID-19, from offering more paid time off to providing resources for homeschooling. Companies should make sure employees are aware of the full range of benefits available to them. Right now, there\u0026rsquo;s a significant gap between what companies offer and what employees are aware of. For example, almost all companies offer mental-health counseling, but only about half of employees know this benefit is available. The same trend holds for other valuable programs such as parenting resources, health checks, and bereavement counseling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs organizations settle into the next normal, they should determine how effectively they are addressing employees\u0026rsquo; biggest challenges and reallocate resources to the programs that are most valuable. Given how unprecedented this crisis is, they should also consider whether their benefits go far enough to support employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6) Strengthen employee communication\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen and frequent \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/communications-get-personal-how-leaders-can-engage-employees-during-a-return-to-work\"\u003ecommunication with employees is critical\u003c/a\u003e, especially in a crisis; when employees are surprised by decisions that have an impact on their work, they are three times more likely to be unhappy in their job. Yet one in five employees have consistently felt uninformed or in the dark during COVID-19. This suggests that companies should share more regular updates on the state of the business and key decisions that affect employees\u0026rsquo; work and lives\u0026mdash;and they should directly address what difficult news means for employees. It\u0026rsquo;s also critical that leaders and HR teams communicate with empathy, so employees feel valued and understood. Research shows that this kind of openness and understanding reduces anxiety and builds trust among employees.[[footnote 13]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e The road to progress\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COVID-19 crisis has prompted companies to rethink fundamental beliefs about remote work. Ninety-three percent of companies now say more jobs can be performed remotely, and close to 70 percent predict a significant share of their employees will regularly work remotely a year from now. [[footnote 14]] Employees see the benefits of remote work, too\u0026mdash;almost eight in ten say they want to continue to work from home more often than they did before COVID-19. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the beginning of a seismic shift in the way we work, with enormous implications. Companies may be able to tap into larger and more diverse talent pools, as opposed to limiting their recruiting to specific regions. And they already anticipate these benefits: 70 percent think remote work will allow them to increase diversity in their hiring. Moreover, remote work will open up opportunities for existing employees\u0026mdash;particularly mothers, caregivers, older employees, and people with disabilities. If companies can create a culture \u003ca href=\"/business-functions/organization/our-insights/reimagining-the-postpandemic-workforce\"\u003ethat supports both in-person and remote workers\u003c/a\u003e, these employees will be able to take on jobs that previously would have required them to relocate, travel extensively, or manage a long commute. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe building blocks of a more empathetic workplace may also be falling into place\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies have made \u003ca href=\"/industries/healthcare/our-insights/national-surveys-reveal-disconnect-between-employees-and-employers-around-mental-health-need\"\u003eemployee mental health and well-being\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;a much higher priority in the face of this crisis. Employees have more visibility than ever before into what\u0026rsquo;s going on in one another\u0026rsquo;s personal lives. And companies say that the crisis has created a feeling of solidarity and fostered empathy and understanding among employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaken together, these dynamics point to an increased focus on supporting employees as \u0026ldquo;whole people.\u0026rdquo; And when employees feel like they can bring their whole selves to work, good things happen: they are happier with their job, more optimistic about their company\u0026rsquo;s commitment to gender and racial equality, and less likely to consider downshifting their role or leaving the workforce. They\u0026rsquo;re also more comfortable sharing challenges with managers and coworkers, giving companies the visibility to make changes that improve employees\u0026rsquo; experiences. It\u0026rsquo;s a positive cycle: the more employees can bring their whole selves to work, the more the workplace will work for them\u0026mdash;and for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is an edited extract from Women in the Workplace 2020, a study undertaken by McKinsey and LeanIn.Org.

But companies need to focus their efforts earlier in the pipeline to make real progress.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year marks the fifth year\u003c/strong\u003e of our research on Women in the Workplace, conducted in partnership with LeanIn.Org. We look back on data and insights since 2015 from close to 600 companies that participated in the study, more than a quarter of a million people that were surveyed on their workplace experiences, and more than 100 in-depth one-on-one interviews that were conducted. (See our infographic below for top-level findings from the past five years.)\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2019infographic]]\n\u003cp\u003eIn the last five years, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen more women rise to the top levels of companies. An increasing number of companies are seeing the value of having more women in leadership, and they\u0026rsquo;re proving that they can make progress on gender diversity. This is an important step in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, women continue to be underrepresented at every level. To change the numbers, companies need to focus where the real problem is. We often talk about the \u0026ldquo;glass ceiling\u0026rdquo; that prevents women from reaching senior leadership positions. In reality, the biggest obstacle that women face is much earlier in the pipeline, at the first step up to manager. Fixing this \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; is the key to achieving parity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe culture of work is equally important. All employees should feel respected and that they have an equal opportunity to grow and advance. Employees care deeply about opportunity and fairness, not only for themselves but for everyone. They want the system to be fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDone right, efforts to hire and promote more diverse candidates and create a strong culture reinforce each other. A more diverse workforce will naturally lead to a more inclusive culture. And when a company\u0026rsquo;s culture feels fair and inclusive, women and underrepresented groups are happier and more likely to thrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy fostering diversity, building a culture of opportunity and fairness, and focusing their attention on the broken rung, companies can close their gender gaps\u0026mdash;and make progress on the road to equality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this article, we share highlights from the full \u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2019\u003c/em\u003e report, diving deep on the parts across pipeline and employee experience that will be most critical for companies to drive change in the next five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDespite progress at senior levels, gender parity remains out of reach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past five years, we have seen signs of progress in the representation of women in corporate America. Since 2015, the number of women in senior leadership has grown. This is particularly true in the C-suite, where the representation of women has increased from 17 percent to 21 percent (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this is a step in the right direction, parity remains out of reach. Women\u0026mdash;and particularly women of color\u0026mdash;are underrepresented at every level.[[footnote 15]] And without fundamental changes early in the pipeline, gains in women\u0026rsquo;s representation will ultimately stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20191]]\n\u003ch3\u003eCompanies are adding more women to the C-suite\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, 44 percent of companies have three or more women in their C-suite, up from 29 percent of companies in 2015 (Exhibit 2). Adding even one woman can make a material difference given the critical role top executives play in shaping the business and culture of their company. Still, the overall representation of women in the C-suite is far from parity. About 1 in 5 C-suite executives is a woman\u0026mdash;and only 1 in 25 C-suite executives is a woman of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20192]]\n\u003ch3\u003eThere are signs the glass ceiling is cracking . . .\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore women are becoming senior leaders. This is driven by two trends. First, more women are being hired at the director level and higher than in the past years. Second, senior-level women are being promoted on average at a higher rate than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, men at the SVP and C-levels are slightly more likely to leave their companies, creating more open positions for women to fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e. . . But a \u0026ldquo;broken rung\u0026rdquo; prevents women from reaching the top\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProgress at the top is constrained by a \u0026ldquo;broken rung.\u0026rdquo; The biggest obstacle women face on the path to senior leadership is at the first step up to manager (Exhibit 3). For every 100 men promoted and hired to manager, only 72 women are promoted and hired. This broken rung results in more women getting stuck at the entry level, and fewer women becoming managers. Not surprisingly, men end up holding 62 percent of manager-level positions, while women hold just 38 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis early inequality has a long-term impact on the talent pipeline. Since men significantly outnumber women at the manager level, there are significantly fewer women to hire or promote to senior managers. The number of women decreases at every subsequent level. So even as hiring and promotion rates improve for women at senior levels, women as a whole can never catch up. There are simply too few women to advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe case for fixing the broken rung is powerful. If women are promoted and hired to first-level manager at the same rates as men, we will add one million more women to management in corporate America over the next five years.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20193]]\n\u003ch3\u003eTo get to gender parity, companies must fix the broken rung\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many companies, diversity efforts in hiring and promotions are focused at senior levels, and we\u0026rsquo;re encouraged by the gains that we are seeing in senior leadership. Now companies need to apply the same rigor to addressing the broken rung. Fixing it will set off a positive chain reaction across the entire pipeline. As more women become managers, there will be more women to promote and hire at each subsequent level. Put another way, more entry-level women will rise to management, and more women in management will rise to senior leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFive steps companies can take to fix their broken rung\u0026mdash;and ultimately their pipeline\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1. Set  a goal for getting more women into first-level management\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a third of companies set targets for the representation of women at first-level management, compared to 41 percent for senior levels of management. Companies should use targets more aggressively. Given how important it is to fix the broken rung, companies would be well served by setting and publicizing a bold goal to grow the number of women at the manager level. Moreover, companies should put targets in place for hiring and promotions, the processes that most directly shape employee representation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. Require diverse slates for hiring and promotions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies are more likely to require diverse candidate slates for promotions at senior levels than at the manager level. But outside research shows that diverse slates can be a powerful driver of change at every level. When two or more women are included on a slate, the likelihood that a woman will get the position rises dramatically.[[footnote 16]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. Put evaluators through unconscious bias training\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconscious bias can play a large role in determining who is hired, promoted, or left behind. Companies are less likely to provide unconscious bias training for employees who participate in entry-level performance reviews than senior-level reviews, but mitigating bias at this stage is particularly important. Candidates tend to have shorter track records early in their careers, and evaluators may make unfair, gendered assumptions about their future potential. There is also compelling evidence that this training works: In companies with smaller gender disparities in representation,[[footnote 17]] half of employees received unconscious bias training in the past year, compared to only a quarter of employees in companies that aren\u0026rsquo;t making progress closing these gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e4. Establish clear evaluation criteria\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need to make sure they have the right processes in place to prevent bias from creeping into hiring and reviews. This means establishing clear evaluation criteria before the review process begins. Evaluation tools should also be easy to use and designed to gather objective, measurable input. For example, a rating scale is generally more effective than an open-ended assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with the right systems in place, processes can break down in practice. Employees are less likely than HR leaders to say that evaluation criteria are defined before candidate reviews begin, and they report that participating employees do not typically flag bias when they see it. This points to the need for companies to put additional safeguards in place to encourage fair, unbiased evaluations. Without exception, candidates for the same role should be evaluated using the same criteria. Employees should feel empowered to surface bias in the moment and have the training and resources to act when they observe it. In addition, outside research shows that it can help to have a third party in the room when evaluators discuss candidates to highlight potential bias and encourage objectivity.[[footnote 18]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e5. Put more women in line for the step up to manager\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is critical that women get the experience they need to be ready for management roles, as well as opportunities to raise their profile so they get tapped for them. The building blocks to make this happen are not new\u0026mdash;leadership training, sponsorship, high-profile assignments\u0026mdash;but many companies need to provide them with a renewed sense of urgency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTogether, opportunity and fairness are the biggest predictors of employee satisfaction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployees universally value opportunity and fairness. Across demographic groups, when employees feel they have equal opportunity for advancement and think the system is fair, they are happier with their career, plan to stay at their company longer, and are more likely to recommend it as a great place to work. In fact, we looked at a number of factors that prior outside research has shown influence employee satisfaction and retention\u0026mdash;including leadership accountability and manager support\u0026mdash;and together opportunity and fairness stand out as the strongest predictors by far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMany employees think they have equal opportunity to advance\u0026mdash;but they are less convinced all employees do\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA majority of employees believe they personally have equal opportunity to grow and advance, but they are less convinced the system is fair for everyone. Fewer than half of women and men think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, and fewer than a quarter say that only the most qualified candidates are promoted to manager. On both fronts, women are less optimistic than men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eA few key practices shape how employees view opportunity and fairness\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManager support, sponsorship, and impartial hiring and promotion practices are key elements in creating a workplace that delivers opportunity and fairness to everyone. Managers and sponsors open doors that help employees advance. And when hiring and promotions are unbiased, the most deserving employees can rise to the top\u0026mdash;and employees feel more confident that the process for advancement is fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e1. Manager support\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagers have a big impact on how employees view their day-to-day opportunities. Employees are more likely to think they have equal opportunities for growth and advancement when their manager helps them manage their career, showcases their work, and advocates for new opportunities for them on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost managers provide this type of career support, and women and men report receiving similar amounts of help from their manager. However, managers don\u0026rsquo;t do these things with enough consistency: only about one in four employees say managers help them manage their career and about one in three say managers advocate for new opportunities for them a great deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies can help by making sure managers have the tools and training they need to more fully support their team members\u0026mdash;and by rewarding them when they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e2. Sponsorship\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSponsorship can open doors, and more employees need it. Fewer than half of the employees at the manager level or higher serve as sponsors, and only one in three employees say they have a sponsor\u0026mdash;and this is equally true for women and men. Moreover, less than a third of employees say they get the sponsorship needed to advance their career. Fortunately, sponsorship is trending in the right direction\u0026mdash;just a year ago, a quarter of employees reported having a sponsor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies would be wise to double down on sponsorship. Outside research shows that sponsorship accelerates career advancement,[[footnote 19]] and employees with sponsors are far more likely to say they have opportunities to grow and advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e3. Inclusive and unbiased hiring and promotions\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen companies have strong hiring and performance review processes in place, employees are more likely to think the system is fair and the most deserving employees are able to rise to the top. Over the past five years, more companies have adopted these best practices, but progress toward full adoption is slow. This year only 6 of 323[[footnote 20]] companies report they do all of the following: set diversity targets, require diverse slates for hiring and promotions, establish clear and consistent evaluation criteria before review processes begin, and require unconscious bias training for employees involved in hiring and performance reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn combination, these are the building blocks needed to foster diversity and minimize bias in decision-making. Given that hiring and promotions are powerful levers in driving pipeline diversity and employee satisfaction, there\u0026rsquo;s a strong business case for adopting more of these best practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSome groups of women receive less support and see less opportunity to advance \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no one story of women in the workplace. Gender is one of many aspects of women\u0026rsquo;s identity that shapes their experiences. Women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, and women with disabilities are having distinct\u0026mdash;and by and large worse\u0026mdash;experiences than women overall. [[footnote 21]] Most notably, Black women and women with disabilities face more barriers to advancement, get less support from managers, and receive less sponsorship than other groups of women. Not surprisingly, Black women and women with disabilities are far less likely to feel they have an equal opportunity to grow and advance and are far less likely to think the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees. They are also less happy at work and more likely to leave their company than other women are. It\u0026rsquo;s important for companies to understand that all women are not having the same experience and to directly address the unique challenges that different groups of women face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCommitment to gender diversity has increased significantly \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, 87 percent of companies are highly committed to gender diversity, compared to 56 percent in 2012, when McKinsey \u0026amp; Company first conducted a similar study on the state of women at work. Since 2015, senior leader and manager commitment to gender diversity has also increased, and employee commitment\u0026mdash;especially among men\u0026mdash;has risen significantly (Exhibit 4).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20194]]\n\u003cp\u003eIt is encouraging that so many companies prioritize gender diversity. However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that employees are less convinced: only half of employees think gender diversity is a high priority to their company, and that number hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed over the last five years. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat employees think matters. When employees say their company is highly committed to gender diversity, they are happier and plan to stay at their company longer. This is equally true for women and men.[[footnote 22]] There are also signs that commitment will continue to trend in a positive direction. Younger generations are more likely to see bias in the workplace\u0026mdash;for example, managers under 30 are more likely to say they see bias than older employees at the same level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTurning commitment into action\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies need to do more to put their commitment into practice and treat gender diversity like the business priority it is. This starts with taking concrete actions like setting diversity targets and sharing diversity metrics\u0026mdash;not just at senior levels, but with all employees. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also means holding leaders accountable and rewarding them when they make progress. In most organizations, what gets measured and rewarded is what gets done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, more companies are putting the right mechanisms in place, and employees are noticing this progress. Compared to last year, employees are almost twice as likely to say their companies have gender diversity targets in place for hiring. However, there is more to be done. When companies have the right foundation for change\u0026mdash;clear goals, obvious accountability, a reward system\u0026mdash;they are in a better position to drive systemic change. Gender diversity efforts shift from a nice-to-have to a must-have, and that leads to broad-based action across the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe right policies can have a big impact: Engaging senior leaders is driving change\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than half of companies hold senior leaders accountable for progress on gender diversity metrics, up from a little over a third in 2015. And it\u0026rsquo;s making a difference. Seventy-three percent of senior leaders are highly committed to gender diversity, and close to half say they\u0026rsquo;re working to improve gender diversity. Senior leaders set the priorities in organizations, so when they\u0026rsquo;re engaged, it has a positive trickle-down effect: Managers are more likely to support diversity efforts, and employees are more likely to think the workplace is fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a next step, companies should push deeper into their organization and engage managers to play a more active role. Compared to senior leaders, fewer managers say gender diversity is a high priority, and far fewer managers say they are actively working to improve diversity and inclusion (Exhibit 20195).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20195]]\n\u003ch4\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJess Huang\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eIrina Starikova\u003c/strong\u003e are partners in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Silicon Valley office, where \u003cstrong\u003eDelia Zanoschi\u003c/strong\u003e is a consultant; \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/alexis-krivkovich\"\u003eAlexis Krivkovich\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/lareina-yee\"\u003eLareina Yee\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e are senior partners in the San Francisco office. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[SectionHeader 2018]]\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"/our-people/alexis-krivkovich\"\u003eAlexis Krivkovich\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/marie-claude-nadeau\"\u003eMarie-Claude Nadeau\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/our-people/kelsey-robinson\"\u003eKelsey Robinson\u003c/a\u003e, Nicole Robinson, Irina Starikova, and \u003ca href=\"/our-people/lareina-yee\"\u003eLareina Yee\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProgress on gender diversity at work has stalled.

But that commitment has not translated into meaningful progress. The proportion of women at every level in corporate America has hardly changed. Progress isn\u0026rsquo;t just slow. It\u0026rsquo;s stalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s what we found in \u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2018\u003c/em\u003e, a study conducted by McKinsey in partnership with LeanIn.Org. In the fourth year of our ongoing research, we probe the issues, drawing on data from 279 companies employing more than 13 million people, as well as on a survey of over 64,000 employees and a series of qualitative interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen are doing their part. For more than 30 years, they\u0026rsquo;ve been earning more bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees than men. They\u0026rsquo;re asking for promotions and negotiating salaries at the same rates as men. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they are staying in the workforce at the same rate as men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow companies need to take more decisive action. This starts with \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/delivering-through-diversity\"\u003etreating gender diversity like the business priority it is\u003c/a\u003e, from setting targets to holding leaders accountable for results. It requires closing gender gaps in hiring and promotions, especially early in the pipeline when women are most often overlooked. And it means taking bolder steps to create a respectful and inclusive culture so women\u0026mdash;and all employees\u0026mdash;feel safe and supported at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article presents highlights from the full report and presents six actions that could spark progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRevisiting the pipeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on four years of data from 462 companies employing more than 19.6 million people, including the 279 companies participating in this year\u0026rsquo;s study, two things are clear: one, women remain underrepresented, particularly women of color. Two, companies need to change the way they hire and promote entry and manager-level employees to make real progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWomen remain underrepresented\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2015, \u003ca href=\"#2015\"\u003ethe first year of this study\u003c/a\u003e, corporate America has made almost no progress improving women\u0026rsquo;s representation. Women are underrepresented at every level, and women of color are the most underrepresented group of all, lagging behind white men, men of color, and white women (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20181]]\n\u003cp\u003eFor the fourth year in a row, attrition does not explain the underrepresentation of women. Women and men are leaving their companies at similar rates, and they have similar intentions to remain in the workforce. Over half of all employees plan to stay at their companies for five or more years, and among those who intend to leave, 81 percent say they will continue to work. It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that remarkably few women and men say they plan to leave the workforce to focus on family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHiring and promotion will be crucial to progress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two biggest drivers of representation are hiring and promotions, and companies are disadvantaging women in these areas from the beginning. Although women earn more bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees than men, and have for decades, they are less likely to be hired into entry-level jobs. At the first critical step up to manager, the disparity widens further. Women are less likely to be hired into manager-level jobs, and they are far less likely to be promoted into them\u0026mdash;for every 100 men promoted to manager, 79 women are (Exhibit 2). Largely because of these gender gaps, men end up holding 62 percent of manager positions, while women hold only 38 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20182]]\n\u003cp\u003eThis early inequality has a profound impact on the talent pipeline. Starting at the manager level, there are significantly fewer women to promote from within and significantly fewer women at the right experience level to hire in from the outside. So even though hiring and promotion rates improve at more senior levels, women can never catch up\u0026mdash;we\u0026rsquo;re suffering from a \u0026ldquo;hollow middle.\u0026rdquo; This should serve as a wake-up call: until companies close the early gaps in hiring and promotion, women will remain underrepresented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf companies continue to hire and promote women to manager at current rates, the number of women in management will increase by just one percentage point over the next ten years. But are companies start hiring and promoting women and men to manager at equal rates, we should get close to parity in management\u0026mdash;48 percent women versus 52 percent men\u0026mdash;over the same ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConsidering an uneven playing field\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany factors contribute to a lack of gender diversity in the workplace. This year, our report took a closer look at some of them. Beyond issues such as managerial support and access to senior leaders, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to look at a few areas that play a role\u0026mdash;including everyday discrimination, sexual harassment, and the experience of being the only woman in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEveryday discrimination\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryday sexism and racism, also known as microaggressions, can take many forms. Some can be subtle, like when someone mistakenly assumes a coworker is more junior than they really are. Some are more explicit, like when someone says something demeaning to a coworker. Whether intentional or unintentional, microaggressions signal disrespect. They also reflect inequality\u0026mdash;while anyone can be on the receiving end of disrespectful behavior, microaggressions are directed at people with less power, such as women, people of color, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor almost two-thirds of women, microaggressions are a workplace reality (Exhibit 3). Most commonly, women have to provide more evidence of their competence than men and have their judgment questioned in their area of expertise. They are also twice as likely as men to have been mistaken for someone in a more junior position. Black women, in particular, deal with a greater variety of microaggressions and are more likely than other women to have their judgment questioned in their area of expertise and be asked to provide additional evidence of their competence.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20183]]\n\u003cp\u003eLesbian women experience further slights: 71 percent have dealt with microaggressions. The nature of these encounters is often different for them: lesbian women are far more likely than other women to hear demeaning remarks in the workplace about themselves or others like them. They are also far more likely to feel like they cannot talk about their personal lives at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese negative experiences add up. As their name suggests, microaggressions can seem small when dealt with one by one. But when repeated over time, they can have a major impact: women who experience microaggressions view their workplaces as less fair and are three times more likely to regularly think about leaving their jobs than women who don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSexual harassment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSexual harassment continues to pervade the workplace. Thirty-five percent of women in corporate America experience sexual harassment at some point in their careers, from hearing sexist jokes to being touched in a sexual way.[[footnote 23]]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some women the experience is far more common. Fifty-five percent of women in senior leadership, 48 percent of lesbian women, and 45 percent of women in technical fields report they\u0026rsquo;ve been sexually harassed. A common thread connects these groups: research has found that women who do not conform to traditional feminine expectations\u0026mdash;in this case, by holding authority, not being heterosexual, and working in fields dominated by men\u0026mdash;are more often the targets of sexual harassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety-eight percent of companies have policies that make it clear sexual harassment is not tolerated, but many employees think their companies are falling short putting policies into practice. Only 62 percent of employees say that in the past year their companies have reaffirmed sexual harassment won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated, and a similar number say that they\u0026rsquo;ve received training or guidance on the topic. Moreover, only 60 percent of employees think a sexual-harassment claim would be fairly investigated and addressed by their company\u0026mdash;and just one in three believe it would be addressed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also stark differences in how women and men view their company\u0026rsquo;s efforts to create a safe and respectful work environment. Only 32 percent of women think that disrespectful behavior toward women is often quickly addressed by their companies, compared with 50 percent of men. Women are far less confident that reporting sexual harassment will lead to a fair investigation. And they are twice as likely as men to say that it would be risky or pointless to report an incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese numbers indicate the urgent need for companies to underscore that bad behavior is unacceptable and will not go overlooked. Leaders at all levels should set the tone by publicly stating sexual harassment won\u0026rsquo;t be tolerated and by modeling inclusive behavior. HR teams should receive detailed training so they know how to thoroughly and compassionately investigate claims of harassment, even if they involve senior leaders. And companies would benefit from putting an audit process in place to ensure that investigations are thorough and sanctions are appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe \u0026lsquo;Only\u0026rsquo; experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing \u0026ldquo;the only one\u0026rdquo; is still a common experience for women. One in five women say they are often the only woman or one of the only women in the room at work: in other words, they are \u0026ldquo;Onlys.\u0026rdquo;  This is twice as common for senior-level women and women in technical roles: around 40 percent are Onlys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who are Onlys are having a significantly worse experience than women who work with other women. More than 80 percent are on the receiving end of microaggressions, compared with 64 percent of women as a whole. They are more likely to have their abilities challenged, to be subjected to unprofessional and demeaning remarks, and to feel like they cannot talk about their personal lives at work (Exhibit 4). Most notably, women Onlys are almost twice as likely to have been sexually harassed at some point in their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20184]]\n\u003cp\u003eFar fewer men are Onlys\u0026mdash;just 7 percent say that they are often the only or one of the only men in the room\u0026mdash;and regardless of their race and ethnicity, they face less scrutiny than women Onlys. By and large, White men who are Onlys have a better experience than any other group of Onlys, likely because they are broadly well represented in their company and are a high-status group in society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen Onlys have a more difficult time. Because there are so few, women Onlys stand out in a crowd of men. This heightened visibility can make the biases women Onlys face especially pronounced. While they are just one person, they often become a stand-in for all women\u0026mdash;their individual successes or failures become a litmus test for what all women are capable of doing. With everyone\u0026rsquo;s eyes on them, women Onlys can be heavily scrutinized and held to higher performance standards. As a result, they most often feel pressure to perform, on guard, and left out. In contrast, when asked how it feels to be the only man in the room, men Onlys most frequently say they feel included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing an Only also affects the way women view their workplace. Compared with other women, women Onlys are less likely to think that the best opportunities go to the most deserving employees, promotions are fair and objective, and ideas are judged by their quality rather than who raised them. Not surprisingly, given the negative experiences and feelings associated with being the odd woman out, women Onlys are also 1.5 times more likely to think about leaving their job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eMapping a path to gender equality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast majority of companies say that they\u0026rsquo;re highly committed to gender and racial diversity\u0026mdash;yet the evidence indicates that many are still not treating diversity as the business imperative it is. That\u0026rsquo;s apparent in the lack of progress in the pipeline over the past four years (Exhibit 5).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20185]]\n\u003cp\u003eTake gender diversity as an example. In contrast with what companies say about their commitment, only around half of all employees think that their company sees gender diversity as a priority and is doing what it takes to make progress.

One of the most powerful reasons for the lack of progress is a simple one: we have blind spots when it comes to diversity, and we can\u0026rsquo;t solve problems that we don\u0026rsquo;t see or understand clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany employees think women are well represented in leadership when they see only a few. And because they\u0026rsquo;ve become comfortable with the status quo, they don\u0026rsquo;t feel any urgency for change. Further, many men don\u0026rsquo;t fully grasp the barriers that hold women back at work. As a result, they are less committed to gender diversity, and we can\u0026rsquo;t get there without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany companies also overlook the realities of women of color, who face the greatest obstacles and receive the least support. When companies take a one-size-fits-all approach to advancing women, women of color end up underserved and left behind. This year we take a deeper look at women of color to better understand the distinct challenges they face, shaped by the intersection of gender and race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article presents highlights from the full report and suggests a few core actions that could kick-start progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTaking a closer look at the corporate pipeline\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[video 2017video1]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"#2016\"\u003eAs in years past\u003c/a\u003e, we examined the corporate pipeline, starting from entry-level professional positions and leading all the way to the C-suite. Two themes emerge this year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInequality starts at the very first promotion. This is even more dramatic for women of color.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Women remain significantly underrepresented in the corporate pipeline (Exhibit 1). From the outset, fewer women than men are hired at the entry level, despite women being 57 percent of recent college graduates. At every subsequent step, the representation of women further declines, and women of color face an even steeper drop-off at senior levels. As a result, one in five C-suite leaders is a woman, and fewer than one in 30 is a woman of color. Moreover, compared with the modest gains women made in prior years, there are signs this year that \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/gender-equality/whats-stalling-progress-for-women-at-work\"\u003ewomen\u0026rsquo;s progress may be stalling\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20171]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen are not leaving their companies at higher rates than men, and very few plan to leave the workforce to focus on family.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Compared with men of the same race and ethnicity, women are leaving their companies at similar rates: White women are leaving as frequently as white men, and we see the same pattern among women and men of color. However, there is a large racial gap: people of color are significantly more likely to leave their organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen and men also have similar intentions to stay in the workforce. Roughly 60 percent of all employees plan to remain at their companies for five or more years. Moreover, among those who are planning to leave, about 80 percent intend to find a job elsewhere and remain in the workforce. Notably, just as many men as women say they\u0026rsquo;ll leave to focus on family, and the number for both genders is remarkably low: 2 percent or less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChanging the workplace experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the results of a survey of more than 70,000 employees from 82 of this year\u0026rsquo;s participating companies, three trends that disadvantage women are clear:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen experience a workplace skewed in favor of men.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e On average, women are promoted at a lower rate than men. The biggest gender gap is at the first step up to manager: entry-level women are 18 percent less likely to be promoted than their male peers. This gender disparity has a dramatic effect on the pipeline as a whole. If entry-level women were promoted at the same rate as their male peers, the number of women at the senior vice president and C-suite levels would more than double. And the disparity in promotions is not for lack of desire to advance. Women are just as interested in being promoted as men, and they ask for promotions at comparable rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps unsurprisingly, women are less optimistic about their prospects. They are less likely than men to aspire to be a top executive. And even the women who aspire to be a top executive are significantly less likely to think they\u0026rsquo;ll become one than men with the same aspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen of color, particularly Black women, face even greater challenges.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e The intersection of race and gender shape women\u0026rsquo;s experiences in meaningful ways. Women of color face more obstacles and a steeper path to leadership, from receiving less support from managers to getting promoted more slowly (Exhibit 2). For instance, although women in general are more likely than men to report they never interact with senior leaders, Black women are the most likely of all to report they never have senior-level contact. This may affect how they view the workplace and their opportunities for advancement. Perhaps because of the challenges they face in the workplace, for example, Black women are also the most interested in going out on their own. Compared with other groups of women, they\u0026rsquo;re significantly more likely to say they intend to start a business when they leave their current job. And yet: despite facing more pitfalls to advancement, women of color have higher ambitions to be a top executive than White women.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20172]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen and men see the state of women\u0026mdash;and the success of gender-diversity efforts\u0026mdash;differently.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Men are more likely to think the workplace is equitable; women see a workplace that is less fair and offers less support (Exhibit 3). Men think their companies are doing a pretty good job supporting diversity; women see more room for improvement. Indeed, nearly 50 percent of men think women are well represented in leadership in companies where only one in ten senior leaders are women. And perhaps unsurprisingly, \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/moving-mind-sets-on-gender-diversity-mckinsey-global-survey-results\"\u003emen are less committed to gender-diversity efforts\u003c/a\u003e, and some even feel that such efforts disadvantage them: 15 percent of men think their gender will make it harder for them to advance, and White men are almost twice as likely as men of color to think this.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20173]]\n\u003ch2\u003eA road map to gender equality\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompanies need a comprehensive plan \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/leadership/time-for-a-new-gender-equality-playbook\"\u003efor supporting and advancing women\u003c/a\u003e.

Women are less likely to receive the first critical promotion to manager\u0026mdash;so far fewer end up on the path to leadership\u0026mdash;and they are less likely to be hired into more senior positions. As a result, the higher you look in companies, the fewer women you see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"#2019\"\u003eWomen in the Workplace\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, a study conducted by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey, elaborates on these patterns, provides some explanations for them, and suggests priorities for leaders seeking to speed the rate of progress. Key findings, based on data from more than 130 companies and over 34,000 men and women, include the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWomen remain underrepresented at every level in the corporate pipeline. Corporate America promotes men at 30 percent higher rates than women during their early career stages, and entry-level women are significantly more likely than men to have spent five or more years in the same role.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eWomen negotiate for promotions and raises as often as men but face more pushback when they do. Women also receive informal feedback less frequently than men\u0026mdash;despite asking for it as often\u0026mdash;and have less access to senior-level sponsors. Not surprisingly, women are almost three times more likely than men to think their gender will make it harder to get a raise, promotion, or chance to get ahead.\u003c/li\u003e\n    \u003cli\u003eThe challenge is even more pronounced for women of color. Our research finds that, compared with White women, women of color face the most barriers and experience the steepest drop-offs with seniority despite having higher aspirations for becoming a top executive. Women of color also report they get less access to opportunities and see a workplace that is less fair and inclusive.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n[[Exhibit 20161]]\n\u003cp\u003eThe report suggests that we are falling short in translating top-level commitment into a truly inclusive work environment. Even when top executives say the right things, employees don\u0026rsquo;t think they have a plan for making progress toward gender equality, don\u0026rsquo;t see those words backed up with action, don\u0026rsquo;t feel confident calling out gender bias when they see it, and don\u0026rsquo;t think frontline managers have gotten the message. Only 45 percent of employees, for example, think their companies are doing what it takes to improve diversity outcomes. And even though more than 70 percent of companies say they are committed to diversity, less than a third of their workers see senior leaders held accountable for improving gender outcomes. Faced with these challenges, it\u0026rsquo;s time to rewrite our gender playbooks so that they do more to change the fabric of everyday work life by encouraging relentless execution, fresh ideas, and courageous personal actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis is an edited extract from\u003c/em\u003e Women in the Workplace 2016, \u003cem\u003ea study undertaken by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey.

But companies may be missing another critical moment: equitable advancement in early promotion. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Sidebar authors]]\n\u003cp\u003eAcross all industries and roles, women are promoted at a slower rate than men. Indeed, only 86 women are promoted to manager for every 100 men at the same level, according to McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2021\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace\"\u003e report, coauthored with LeanIn.Org\u003c/a\u003e. But the gender gap for women in technical roles is more pronounced, with only 52\u0026nbsp;women being promoted to manager for every 100 men. Diversity is especially crucial in these roles to help \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-bias-in-artificial-intelligence-and-in-humans\"\u003edebias the technologies\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;that make up an ever-present and evolving component of modern life.[[Footnote 1]] Further, McKinsey research has shown that a strong relationship exists between diversity on leadership teams and the likelihood of financial outperformance for companies: the most gender-diverse companies are \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003e48 percent more likely\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;to outperform the least gender-diverse companies. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKinsey and Girls in Tech set out to better understand the barriers that impede women in technical roles from earning early promotions. We conducted nearly 40 interviews with early-tenure individuals in technical roles and with the leaders and supervisors who oversee promotions, among others.[[Footnote 2]] What we learned is that some companies are instituting a systematic approach to advancing women in technical roles and reaping the benefits of a more diverse, inclusive, and higher-performing workforce. In this article, we describe three enablers that have helped companies repair the broken rung on the career ladder for women in technical roles: providing equitable access to skill building, implementing a structured process that seeks to debias promotions, and building a strong culture of support for women via mentors (who can provide encouragement and empathy, as well as help women work toward goals and address challenges or obstacles) and sponsors (who can create opportunities and actively advocate for the advancement of those they sponsor).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy the broken rung matters\u003c/h2\u003e\n[[MostPopularArticles 5]]\n\u003cp\u003eEarly promotions in a career are most critical to success,[[Footnote 3]] and yet for the past eight years, McKinsey research has consistently shown that women lose ground in the step up to manager. According to data from our research conducted for the \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWomen in the Workplace 2021\u003c/em\u003e report\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, women hold only 34\u0026nbsp;percent of entry-level engineering and product roles and just 26 percent of first-level manager positions, compared with 48 percent of entry-level roles and 41 percent of first-level manager positions in the pipeline overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy failing to promote and retain women in technical roles who are in the early stages of their careers, companies end up preparing fewer women for senior roles. This affects women\u0026rsquo;s lives and livelihoods and could create negative financial and cultural consequences for companies, since companies where \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003ewomen are well represented at the top earn up to 50 percent higher profits and share performance\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the leaders we interviewed acknowledged that their companies have uneven early-promotions processes that perpetuate the broken rung on the career ladder for women in technical roles. But few said that their companies had begun to monitor the advancement of women in these roles during the first five years after they are hired. And while many interviewees said that their companies offer mentorship programs, conscious inclusion training, and other diversity and inclusion programs, only a small number could name interventions aimed at achieving gender parity in promotions for early-tenure women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;There is something unique about retaining a woman \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; player. It requires out-of-the-box thinking and creativity that we are not applying today. We wait until women are ready to leave before we get creative about giving them roles they\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female chief experience office, technology\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat can be done and how to get it right\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFixing the broken rung will require concentrated efforts. Our interviews highlighted three enablers that companies have used to help women in technical roles secure a track toward important early-career promotions (Exhibit 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 1]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Provide equitable access to training, projects, and other resources to accelerate skill building for women in technical roles \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a promotion to be successful, the new role should be a good fit, in both skill level and temperament, for the advancing employee; the person who\u0026rsquo;s moved up should be able to thrive and continue to grow in the new position. For this to happen, groundwork needs to be laid ahead of time via access to timely opportunities that help colleagues demonstrate their growth and maturity and readiness to advance. Our interviews suggest that companies can better support the advancement of women in technical roles by providing them with opportunities to build a wide array of skills, along with structured guidance on their professional development. Leading companies can expand formal skills development beyond technical training, offering resources such as sessions on how to prioritize career development and how to be effective in promotion interviews; matching programs that pair women with sponsors (who can offer seniority, power, and influence to help those they are sponsoring meet their goals); networking groups; and a formalized professional-development process. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[PullQuote 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also important for women in technical roles to join high-visibility projects where they can develop their skills on the job. One interviewee, from a tech firm, explained that their company had created a skills-based promotion process for early-tenure employees. The process specified indicators of success for milestones linked to promotion decisions. However, the company hadn\u0026rsquo;t created an easy way for employees to find projects where they could develop the skills expected at higher ranks. Feeling deprived of these valuable opportunities, women told us they perceived promotions as unattainable, and many chose to leave. To correct this, some companies have created project databases where tech employees can search for opportunities according to the type of skills required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Early promotions can be heavily influenced by perception. If you have one good project, high visibility or proximity to the right leaders, you become part of the inner circle and get promoted faster. We are geographically diverse, but it may be that people in the headquarters interact more with senior leadership and get the best projects. We are implementing an early-career program that tries to curtail the \u0026lsquo;inner circle\u0026rsquo; problem by enabling women to have more meet and greets, rotational opportunities, and formal mentorship.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female HR leader, healthcare\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Implement a structured approach to early promotions \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur interviews suggest that many organizations could do much more to standardize their promotion processes for early-tenure technical roles and eliminate unintentional bias. Only two of the 40\u0026nbsp;leaders we spoke with said that their organizations do not have a broken-rung problem. Both work for large, Fortune 100 technology companies that have invested heavily in highly structured, clear, and transparent systems, with well-defined skills criteria for each role and level (Exhibit 2). Both companies have developed extensive manager training programs, built accountability into their processes, and set clear bars for when the first two promotions should be expected. Employees at these companies check in with managers frequently to ensure that they have access to projects that will help them gain the skills they need to advance, and when employees don\u0026rsquo;t advance in the projected timelines, senior leaders follow up to understand the impediments. Early-tenure promotions are decided by committee rather than by individuals, and bias checks are integrated into the process. Because these companies set expectations in which everyone must advance within a specified time, they are effectively aiming for 100 percent participation in early-tenure promotions. \u003c/p\u003e\n[[Exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;My company had a timeline for when you should be asking questions of your mentor [about being promoted]. The structure was incredible for me because it gave me the opportunity to have the right conversations and a perspective on where I should be in the process. It was like running a marathon and having someone tell you where the water stations are.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female supervisor, industrial \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen who work at organizations that lack a clear, equitable promotion structure for early-tenure employees say they face an upward pathway that can be ambiguous, uneven, and biased. For example, one interviewee mentioned a company rule that employees must work full-time for seven months or more within a calendar year before being considered for promotion. This requirement omits many women who take maternity leave. Other interviewees said that their companies\u0026rsquo; promotion processes tend to favor people with close proximity to leaders, which can impede the advancement of employees who work remotely or in satellite offices. Obstacles such as these make it difficult for women in technical roles to earn promotions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;The word I\u0026rsquo;d use to describe promotions is \u0026lsquo;struggle.\u0026rsquo; I personally have seen people that look like me continue to be overlooked for promotions. We have to work two to five times harder to get a promotion. In my seven years here, I\u0026rsquo;ve been promoted multiple times. It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears on my end and me raising a concern as to why there aren\u0026rsquo;t more people that look like me represented in the leadership team.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female supervisor, media\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Connect early-tenure women with capable managers, mentors, and sponsors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing that senior colleagues play a valuable role in the professional development of workers who are early in their careers, leading companies take measures to help women in technical roles connect with people who have more experience. Direct managers often play an especially important role in the professional lives of early-tenure employees. They have the most direct view of the employee\u0026rsquo;s responsibilities and performance, and they serve as the coach, advocate, and decision maker for the employee\u0026rsquo;s promotion. However, many managers of junior tech employees have little management training or experience themselves. Even with good intentions, they can create uneven experiences for early-tenure workers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading companies counter these shortcomings by investing in the development of managers at lower levels. A new manager at a tech company, who had just received her second promotion, told us about the stress of having to promote people for the first time. However, her company provided extensive training and documentation to help her make a strong case for the advancement of her team\u0026rsquo;s members. Her own supervisor also stepped in, setting up quarterly meetings to discuss the potential promotions for her team. All these actions gave the new manager the tools that helped her to act as a sponsor for her own team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;When I went for my first chief architect role, I didn\u0026rsquo;t get it. Then the head of enterprise architecture called me and said, \u0026lsquo;You were number two. Let me tell you what you need to work on.\u0026rsquo; He gave me actionable feedback. If he had not called, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I would\u0026rsquo;ve gone for it again. Who knows how that would\u0026rsquo;ve affected my path? He gave me something actionable, and that is a gift I now give to everyone I meet. One year later, I got promoted because I worked on what he said, and I was prepared for the next opportunity.\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash;Female chief engineer, banking\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentors and sponsors can help women in technical roles develop leadership and management skills, improve their interviewing abilities, and focus on the skills needed to advance. Indeed, at companies that lack clear promotion structures or well-trained managers, mentors and sponsors play an outsize part in educating and coaching women on a company\u0026rsquo;s unwritten expectations, and in advocating for their advancement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chief information officer at a large bank told us about her experience receiving support from sponsors. When she first became eligible for promotion, she believed that she could apply only if all her skills matched the stated job requirements. But her sponsors counseled her that the leaders in charge of promotions considered some skills essential but saw others as skills that candidates could develop on the job. One particular leader advised her on which specific skills to develop and showcase. Acting on that feedback, she felt well prepared for the promotion interview and advanced quickly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr /\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is ample opportunity for companies to focus on the early-career development of women in technical roles and to deepen a talent pool that is integral to their success. Our research shows what leading companies have done to make career development easier\u0026mdash;and fairer\u0026mdash;for women in technical roles. The combination of career-development opportunities, structured promotion processes, and support from senior colleagues has proven effective at advancing and retaining women in technical roles and can, in time, help diversify leadership teams. While these interventions may feel applicable to women in any role, the impact on technology functions by applying them can be significant\u0026mdash;particularly because only a few companies are focusing on the broken rung in those fields today. And these improvements are not only good for business performance: they can also help women in technical roles realize significant professional benefits of their own.\u003c/p\u003e"},"Link5":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link3":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link4":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link2":{"value":{"href":""}},"Link1":{"value":{"href":""}},"Authors":[],"UseEnhancedAuthors":{"value":false},"Acknowledgements":{"value":""},"About The Authors":{"value":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSian Griffiths\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in McKinsey\u0026rsquo;s Washington, DC, office, \u003cstrong\u003ePetra Kubalcikova\u003c/strong\u003e is a user research lead in the Prague office, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"/our-people/gayatri-shenai\"\u003eGayatri Shenai\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a partner in the New York office, and \u003cstrong\u003eCathy Wright\u003c/strong\u003e is a technology and digital change director in the Bay Area office. \u003cstrong\u003eAdriana Gascoigne\u003c/strong\u003e is the founder and CEO of Girls in Tech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe authors wish to thank their sponsors and advisers from Girls in Tech, including Sastry Durvasula, as well as Kweilin Ellingrud, Nora Gardner, Olga Kulak, Shalonna Melton, Siddharth Muchhal, D.
